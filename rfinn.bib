	Abstract = {We describe the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) and the first data obtained as part of the science demonstration phase (SDP). The data cover a central 4×4 sq deg region of the cluster. We use SPIRE and PACS photometry data to produce 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 mum luminosity functions (LFs) for optically bright galaxies that are selected at 500 mum and detected in all bands. We compare these LFs with those previously derived using IRAS, BLAST and Herschel-ATLAS data. The Virgo cluster LFs do not have the large numbers of faint galaxies or examples of very luminous galaxies seen previously in surveys covering less dense environments.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the role of the delineated cosmic web/filaments on star formation activity by exploring a sample of 425 narrow-band selected Halpha emitters, as well as 2846 color-color selected underlying star-forming galaxies for a large-scale structure at z = 0.84 in the COSMOS field from the HiZELS survey. Using the scale-independent Multi-scale Morphology Filter algorithm, we are able to quantitatively describe the density field and disentangle it into its major components: fields, filaments, and clusters. We show that the observed median star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific SFR, the mean SFR-mass relation, and its scatter for both Halpha emitters and underlying star-forming galaxies do not strongly depend on different classes of environment, in agreement with previous studies. However, the fraction of Halpha emitters varies with environment and is enhanced in filamentary structures at z ~ 1. We propose mild galaxy-galaxy interactions as the possible physical agent for the elevation of the fraction of Halpha star-forming galaxies in filaments. Our results show that filaments are the likely physical environments that are often classed as the "intermediate" densities and that the cosmic web likely plays a major role in galaxy formation and evolution which has so far been poorly investigated.},

@article{kitaura09,
	Abstract = {We present the largest Wiener reconstruction of the cosmic density field made to date. The reconstruction is based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 6 covering the northern Galactic cap. We use a novel supersampling algorithm to suppress aliasing effects and a Krylov-space inversion method to enable high performance with high resolution. These techniques are implemented in the ARGO computer code. We reconstruct the field over a 500Mpc cube with Mpc grid resolution while accounting for both the angular and the radial selection functions of the SDSS, and the shot noise giving an effective resolution of the order of ~10Mpc. In addition, we correct for the redshift distortions in the linear and non-linear regimes in an approximate way. We show that the commonly used method of inverse weighting the galaxies by the corresponding selection function heads to excess noise in regions where the density of the observed galaxies is small. It is more accurate and conservative to adopt a Bayesian framework in which we model the galaxy selection/detection process to be Poisson binomial. This results in heavier smoothing in regions of reduced sampling density. Our results show a complex cosmic web structure with huge void regions indicating that the recovered matter distribution is highly non-Gaussian. Filamentary structures are clearly visible on scales of up to ~20Mpc. We also calculate the statistical distribution of density after smoothing the reconstruction with Gaussian kernels of different radii rS and find good agreement with a lognormal distribution for 10Mpc <~ rS <~ 30Mpc.},

	Abstract = {We present a multiwavelength analysis of a compact group of galaxies infalling at high speed into the dynamically young cluster Abell 1367. Peculiar morphologies and unusually high Halpha emission are associated with two giant galaxies and at least ten dwarfs/extragalactic HII regions, making this group the region with the highest density of star formation activity ever observed in the local clusters. Moreover Halpha imaging observations reveal extraordinary complex trails of ionized gas behind the galaxies, with projected lengths exceeding 150 kpc. These unique cometary trails mark the gaseous trajectory of galaxies, witnessing their dive into the hot cluster intergalactic medium. Under the combined action of tidal forces among group members and the ram-pressure by the cluster ambient medium, the group galaxies were fragmented and the ionized gas was blown out. The properties of this group suggest that environmental effects within infalling groups may have represented a preprocessing step of the galaxy evolution during the high redshift cluster assembly phase.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the filamentary structures of galaxies around the Virgo cluster, exploiting a larger dataset based on the HyperLeda database than previous studies. In particular, this includes a large number of low-luminosity galaxies, resulting in better sampled individual structures. We confirm seven known structures in the distance range 4~$h^{-1}$~Mpc~$<$ SGY~$<$ 16~$h^{-1}$ Mpc, now identified as filaments, where SGY is the axis of the supergalactic coordinate system roughly along the line of sight. The Hubble diagram of the filament galaxies suggests they are infalling toward the main-body of the Virgo cluster. We propose that the collinear distribution of giant elliptical galaxies along the fundamental axis of the Virgo cluster is smoothly connected to two of these filaments (Leo~II~A and B). Behind the Virgo cluster (16~$h^{-1}$~Mpc~$<$ SGY~$<$ 27~$h^{-1}$~Mpc), we also identify a new filament elongated toward the NGC 5353/4 group ("NGC 5353/4 filament") and confirm a sheet that includes galaxies from the W and M clouds of the Virgo cluster ("W-M sheet"). In the Hubble diagram, the NGC 5353/4 filament galaxies show infall toward the NGC 5353/4 group, whereas the W-M sheet galaxies do not show hints of gravitational influence from the Virgo cluster. The filamentary structures identified can now be used to better understand the generic role of filaments in the build-up of galaxy clusters at z~$\approx$~0.},

	Abstract = {We present a new catalog of galaxies in the wider region of the Virgo cluster, based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. The Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog (EVCC) covers an area of 725 deg2 or 60.1 Mpc2. It is 5.2 times larger than the footprint of the classical Virgo Cluster Catalog (VCC) and reaches out to 3.5 times the virial radius of the Virgo cluster. We selected 1324 spectroscopically targeted galaxies with radial velocities less than 3000 km s-1. In addition, 265 galaxies that have been overlooked in the SDSS spectroscopic survey but have available redshifts in the NASA Extragalactic Database are also included. Our selection process secured a total of 1589 galaxies, 676 of which are not included in the VCC. The certain and possible cluster members are defined by means of redshift comparison with a cluster infall model. We employed two independent and complementary galaxy classification schemes: the traditional morphological classification based on the visual inspection of optical images and a characterization of galaxies from their spectroscopic features. SDSS u, g, r, i, and z passband photometry of all EVCC galaxies was performed using Source Extractor. We compare the EVCC galaxies with the VCC in terms of morphology, spatial distribution, and luminosity function. The EVCC defines a comprehensive galaxy sample covering a wider range in galaxy density that is significantly different from the inner region of the Virgo cluster. It will be the foundation for forthcoming galaxy evolution studies in the extended Virgo cluster region, complementing ongoing and planned Virgo cluster surveys at various wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {It is argued that the Local Supercluster (LS) consists of two distinct components: a disk component with 60% of the luminous galaxies, and a halo component with 40% of the luminous galaxies. In regard to the halo component, almost all the luminous galaxies are associated with only a small number of clouds; hence, most of the volume off the disk of the LS is empty. The clouds in the halo are sufficiently separated from the disk so that the two-component distinction seems warranted, and at least the more prominent clouds in the halo seem to be prolate structures with their long axes directed toward the Virgo Cluster. In regard to the disk component, the ratio of the longest to the shortest axis is 6 to 1 (practically independent of velocity effects), and the absolute rms dimension of the short axis is + or - 1.1/h Mpc (h = H0/100 km/s-Mpc). If velocities normal to the plane of the LS are very low, the implication is that the disk was formed through dissipative processes.},

	Abstract = {Context. Observations of nearby starburst and spiral galaxies have revealed that molecular gas is the driver of star formation. However, some nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxies are actively forming stars, but CO, the most common tracer of this reservoir, is faint, leaving us with a puzzle about how star formation proceeds in these environments.  Aims: We aim to quantify the molecular gas reservoir in a subset of 6 galaxies from the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey with newly acquired CO data and to link this reservoir to the observed star formation activity.  Methods: We present CO(1-0), CO(2-1), and CO(3-2) observations obtained at the ATNF Mopra 22-m, APEX, and IRAM 30-m telescopes, as well as [C ii] 157mum and [O i] 63mum observations obtained with the Herschel/PACS spectrometer in the 6 low-metallicity dwarf galaxies: Haro 11, Mrk 1089, Mrk 930, NGC 4861, NGC 625, and UM 311. We derived their molecular gas masses from several methods, including using the CO-to-H2 conversion factor XCO (both Galactic and metallicity-scaled values) and dust measurements. The molecular and atomic gas reservoirs were compared to the star formation activity. We also constrained the physical conditions of the molecular clouds using the non-LTE code RADEX and the spectral synthesis code Cloudy.  Results: We detect CO in 5 of the 6 galaxies, including first detections in Haro 11 (Z ~ 0.4 Z&sun;), Mrk 930 (0.2 Z&sun;), and UM 311 (0.5 Z&sun;), but CO remains undetected in NGC 4861 (0.2 Z&sun;). The CO luminosities are low, while [C ii] is bright in these galaxies, resulting in [C ii]/CO(1-0) >= 10 000. Our dwarf galaxies are in relatively good agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for total gas. They show short molecular depletion timescales, even when considering metallicity-scaled XCO factors. Those galaxies are dominated by their H i gas, except Haro 11, which has high star formation efficiency and is dominated by ionized and molecular gas. We determine the mass of each ISM phase in Haro 11 using Cloudy and estimate an equivalent XCO factor that is 10 times higher than the Galactic value. Overall, our results confirm the emerging picture that CO suffers from significant selective photodissociation in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The main feature of the spatial large-scale galaxy distribution is its intricate network of galaxy filaments. This network is spanned by the galaxy locations that can be interpreted as a three-dimensional point distribution. The global properties of the point process can be measured by different statistical methods, which, however, do not describe directly the structure elements. The morphology of the large-scale structure, on the other hand, is an important property of the galaxy distribution. Here, we apply an object point process with interactions (the Bisous model) to trace and extract the filamentary network in the presently largest galaxy redshift survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We search for filaments in the galaxy distribution that have a radius of about 0.5 h-1 Mpc. We divide the detected network into single filaments and present a public catalogue of filaments. We study the filament length distribution and show that the longest filaments reach the length of 60 h-1 Mpc. The filaments contain 35-40 per cent of the total galaxy luminosity and they cover roughly 5-8 per cent of the total volume, in good agreement with N-body simulations and previous observational results.},

	Abstract = {We perform a comparative analysis of the properties of galaxies infalling into groups classifying them accordingly to whether they are: falling along filamentary structures; or they are falling isotropically. For this purpose, we identify filamentary structures connecting massive groups of galaxies in the SDSS. We perform a comparative analysis of some properties of galaxies in filaments, in the isotropic infall region, in the field, and in groups. We study the luminosity functions (LF) and the dependence of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) on stellar mass, galaxy type, and projected distance to the groups that define the filaments. We find that the LF of galaxies in filaments and in the isotropic infalling region are basically indistinguishable between them, with the possible exception of late-type galaxies. On the other hand, regardless of galaxy type, their LFs are clearly different from that of field or group galaxies. Both of them have characteristic absolute magnitudes and faint end slopes in between the field and group values. More significant differences between galaxies in filaments and in the isotropic infall region are observed when we analyse the SSFR. We find that galaxies in filaments have a systematically higher fraction of galaxies with low SSFR as a function of both, stellar mass and distance to the groups, indicating a stronger quenching of the star formation in the filaments compared to both, the isotropic infalling region, and the field. Our results suggest that some physical mechanisms that determine the differences observed between field galaxies and galaxies in systems, affect galaxies even when they are not yet within the systems.},

	Abstract = {The properties of star formation in galaxies and their dependence on environment play an important role in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.Using the galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), different groups have studied the physical property and the large-scale environment of galaxies. Here we use the filament catalog from Tempel et al. and classified galaxies catalog from Wang et al., considering the affect of shape of galaxies, high and low local density environment, and central (satellite) galaxies. It is found that the properties of galaxies and the large-scale environment are related: the SSFR (specific star formation rate) and SFR (star formation rate) strongly depend on large-scale environment only for spiral galaxies and satellite galaxies, but this dependence is very weak for elliptical galaxies and the central galaxies, and the influence of large-scale environment on galaxies in low density region is more sensitive than that in high density region. The above conclusion remains valid even for the galaxies with the same mass. In addition, the SSFR distributions from Tempel et al.'s catalog and Wang et al.'s catalog are not entirely consistent.},

	Abstract = {We describe a far-infrared survey of the Coma cluster and the galaxy filament it resides within. Our survey covers an area of ˜150 deg2 observed by Herschel H-ATLAS (Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey) in five bands at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 mum. The SDSS spectroscopic survey (mr <= 17.8) is used to define an area (within the virial radius) and redshift selected (4268 < v < 9700 km s-1) sample of 744 Coma cluster galaxies - the Coma Cluster Catalogue. For comparison, we also define a sample of 951 galaxies in the connecting filament - the Coma Filament Catalogue. The optical positions and parameters are used to define appropriate apertures to measure each galaxy's far-infrared emission. We have detected 99 of 744 (13 per cent) and 422 of 951 (44 per cent) of the cluster and filament galaxies in the SPIRE 250 mum band. We consider the relative detection rates of galaxies of different morphological types finding that it is only the S0/Sa population that shows clear differences between the cluster and filament. We find no differences between the dust masses and temperatures of cluster and filament galaxies with the exception of early-type galaxy dust temperatures, which are significantly hotter in the cluster than in the filament (X-ray heating?). From a chemical evolution model, we find no evidence for different evolutionary processes (gas loss or infall) between galaxies in the cluster and filament.},

	Abstract = {We present ISOCAM imaging data at 6.75 and 15 mu m for 145 galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in the Coma/A1367 supercluster. Of these, 99 form a complete, optically-selected, volume-limited sample including galaxies in the core and in the periphery of the Virgo cluster, suitable for statistical analysis. 34 of the Virgo galaxies were resolved by ISOCAM: for these objects we present mid-IR images, radial light and colour profiles, as well as effective and isophotal radii, surface brightness and light concentration indices.  The mid-IR colours of the target galaxies show a weak trend with the H band luminosity, with values of F(6.75 mu m)/F(15 mu m) ge  1 found generally in massive objects (LH>=1010 LHsun), and F(6.75 mu m)/F(15 mu m) le  1 in low-mass (LH <=  1010 LHsun) dwarf galaxies. All early-type galaxies (type le  S0a) have F(6.75 mu m)/F(15 mu m) ge  1, as expected when the mid-IR emission is dominated by the photosphere of the cold stellar population. The mid-IR, near-IR and visible light concentration indices of bright galaxies are tightly correlated with one another, indicating that the spatial distribution of the mid-IR emitting sources is, to the first order, similar to that of the stars.

@article{boselli04,
	Abstract = {We study the relationship between the mid-IR (5-18 mum) emission of late-type galaxies and various other star formation tracers in order to investigate the nature of the dust heating sources in this spectral domain. The analysis is carried out using a sample of 123 normal, late-type, nearby galaxies with available data at several frequencies. The mid-IR luminosity (normalized to the H-band luminosity) correlates better with the far-IR luminosity than with more direct tracers of the young stellar population such as the Halpha and the UV luminosity. The comparison of resolved images reveals a remarkable similarity in the Halpha and mid-IR morphologies, with prominent HII regions at both frequencies. The mid-IR images, however, show in addition a diffuse emission not associated with HII regions nor with the diffuse Halpha emission. This evidence indicates that the stellar population responsible for the heating of dust emitting in the mid-IR is similar to that heating big grains emitting in the far-IR, including relatively evolved stars responsible for the non-ionizing radiation. The scatter in the mid-IR vs. Halpha, UV and far-IR luminosity relation is mostly due to metallicity effects, with metal-poor objects having a lower mid-IR emission per unit star formation rate than metal-rich galaxies. Our analysis indicates that the mid-IR luminosity is not an optimal star formation tracer in normal, late-type galaxies.},

	Abstract = {By combining Herschel-SPIRE observations obtained as part of the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey with 21 cm Hi data from the literature, we investigate the role of the cluster environment on the dust content of Virgo spiral galaxies. We show for the first time that the extent of the dust disk is significantly reduced in Hi-deficient galaxies, following remarkably well the observed ``truncation'' of the Hi disk. The ratio of the submillimetre-to-optical diameter correlates with the Hi-deficiency, suggesting that the cluster environment is able to strip dust as well as gas. These results provide important insights not only into the evolution of cluster galaxies but also into the metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Abstract = {The GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS) is a complete blind survey of the Virgo cluster covering ~40 sq. deg in the far UV (FUV, lambdaeff = 1539 {\AA}, Deltalambda = 442 {\AA}) and ~120 sq. deg in the near UV (NUV, lambdaeff = 2316 {\AA}, Deltalambda = 1060 {\AA}). The goal of the survey is to study the ultraviolet (UV) properties of galaxies in a rich cluster environment, spanning a wide luminosity range from giants to dwarfs, and regardless of prior knowledge of their star formation activity. The UV data will be combined with those in other bands (optical: NGVS; far-infrared - submm: HeViCS; HI: ALFALFA) and with our multizone chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution to make a complete and exhaustive study of the effects of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in high density regions. We present here the scientific objectives of the survey, describing the observing strategy and briefly discussing different data reduction techniques. Using UV data already in-hand for the central 12 sq. deg we determine the FUV and NUV luminosity functions of the Virgo cluster core for all cluster members and separately for early- and late-type galaxies and compare it to the one obtained in the field and other nearby clusters (Coma, A1367). This analysis shows that the FUV and NUV luminosity functions of the core of the Virgo clusters are flatter (alpha ~ -1.1) than those determined in Coma and A1367. We discuss the possible origin of this difference.  Table 1 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We present Herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (ETGs), including 39 galaxies morphologically classified as S0+S0a and 23 galaxies classified as ellipticals using SPIRE at 250, 350, and 500 mum as part of the volume-limited Herschel Reference Survey (HRS). We detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the S0s. The mean temperature of the dust is langTd rang = 23.9 $\pm$ 0.8 K, warmer than that found for late-type galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. The mean dust mass for the entire detected early-type sample is logMd = 6.1 $\pm$ 0.1 M &sun; with a mean dust-to-stellar-mass ratio of log(Md /M *) = -4.3 $\pm$ 0.1. Including the non-detections, these parameters are logMd = 5.6 $\pm$ 0.1 and log(Md /M *) = -5.1 $\pm$ 0.1, respectively. The average dust-to-stellar-mass ratio for the early-type sample is fifty times lower, with larger dispersion, than the spiral galaxies observed as part of the HRS, and there is an order-of-magnitude decline in Md /M * between the S0s and ellipticals. We use UV and optical photometry to show that virtually all the galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detections of cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios, and the ratios of far-infrared to radio emission all suggest that many ETGs contain a cool interstellar medium similar to that in late-type galaxies. We show that the sizes of the dust sources in S0s are much smaller than those in early-type spirals and the decrease in the dust-to-stellar-mass ratio from early-type spirals to S0s cannot simply be explained by an increase in the bulge-to-disk ratio. These results suggest that the disks in S0s contain much less dust (and presumably gas) than the disks of early-type spirals and this cannot be explained simply by current environmental effects, such as ram-pressure stripping. The wide range in the dust-to-stellar-mass ratio for ETGs and the lack of a correlation between dust mass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the ETGs detected by Herschel has been acquired as the result of interactions, although we show these are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellar masses of the ETGs. The Herschel observations tentatively suggest that in the most massive systems, the mass of interstellar medium is unconnected to the evolution of the stellar populations in these galaxies.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Abstract = {The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) is a program that uses the 1 deg2 MegaCam instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to carry out a comprehensive optical imaging survey of the Virgo cluster, from its core to its virial radius---covering a total area of 104 deg2---in the u*griz bandpasses. Thanks to a dedicated data acquisition strategy and processing pipeline, the NGVS reaches a point-source depth of g ≈ 25.9 mag (10sigma) and a surface brightness limit of mu g  ~ 29 mag arcsec-2 (2sigma above the mean sky level), thus superseding all previous optical studies of this benchmark galaxy cluster. In this paper, we give an overview of the technical aspects of the survey, such as areal coverage, field placement, choice of filters, limiting magnitudes, observing strategies, data processing and calibration pipelines, survey timeline, and data products. We also describe the primary scientific topics of the NGVS, which include: the galaxy luminosity and mass functions; the color-magnitude relation; galaxy scaling relations; compact stellar systems; galactic nuclei; the extragalactic distance scale; the large-scale environment of the cluster and its relationship to the Local Supercluster; diffuse light and the intracluster medium; galaxy interactions and evolutionary processes; and extragalactic star clusters. In addition, we describe a number of ancillary programs dealing with "foreground" and "background" science topics, including the study of high-inclination trans-Neptunian objects; the structure of the Galactic halo in the direction of the Virgo Overdensity and Sagittarius Stream; the measurement of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy, and cluster lensing; and the identification of distant galaxy clusters, and strong-lensing events.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {In a five hour Halpha exposure of the northwest region of the Coma cluster with the 2.1 m telescope at San Pedro Martir (Mx), we discovered a 65 kpc cometary emission of ionized gas trailing behind the SBab galaxy NGC 4848. The tail points in the opposite direction of the cluster center, in the same direction where stripped HI had been detected in previous observations. The galaxy shows bright HII regions in an inner ring-like pattern, where the star formation takes place at the prodigious rate of ~8.9 M&sun; yr-1. From the morphologies of the galaxy and the trailing material, we infer that the galaxy is suffering from ram pressure due to its high velocity motion through the intergalactic medium. We estimate that ~4 × 109 M&sun; of gas is swept out from the galaxy forming the tail. Given the ambient conditions in the Coma cluster (rho0 = 6.3 × 10-27 g cm-3; sigmavel = 940 km s-1), simulations predict that the ram pressure mechanism is able to remove such an amount of gas in less than 200 Myr. This, combined with the geometry of the interaction, is indicative of radial infall into the cluster, leading to the conclusion that NGC 4848 has been caught during its first passage through the dense cluster environment.  Observations taken at the observatory of San Pedro Martir (Baja California, Mexico), belonging to the Mexican Observatorio Astron{\'o}mico Nacional.},

	Abstract = {Context. We present Halpha3 (acronym for Halpha - alphaalpha), an Halpha narrow-band imaging survey of ~400 galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) in the Local Supercluster, including the Virgo cluster.  Aims: By using hydrogen recombination lines as a tracer of recent star formation, we aim to investigate the relationships between atomic neutral gas and newly formed stars in different environments (cluster and field), morphological types (spirals and dwarfs), and over a wide range of stellar masses (~107.5 - 1011.5 M&sun;).  Methods: We image in Halpha+[NII] all the galaxies that contain more than 107 M&sun; of neutral atomic hydrogen in the sky region 11h < RA < 16h; 4$\,^{\circ}$ < Dec < 16$\,^{\circ}$; 350 < cz < 2000 km s-1 using the San Pedro Martir 2 m telescope. This survey provides a complete census of the star formation in HI rich galaxies of the local universe.  Results: We present the properties of the galaxy sample, together with Halpha fluxes and equivalent widths. We find an excellent agreement between the fluxes determined from our images in apertures of 3 arcsec diameter and the fluxes derived from the SDSS spectral database. From the Halpha fluxes corrected for galactic and internal extinction and for [NII] contamination we derive the global star formation rates (SFRs).  Observations taken at the observatory of San Pedro Martir (Baja California, Mexico), belonging to the Mexican Observatorio Astron{\'o}mico Nacional.FITS images for all galaxies are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/545/A16},

	Abstract = {The Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) is the deepest, confusion-limited survey of the Virgo Cluster at far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths. The entire survey at full depth covers ˜55 deg2 in five bands (100-500 mum), encompassing the areas around the central dominant elliptical galaxies (M87, M86 and M49) and extends as far as the NW cloud, the W cloud and the Southern extension. The survey extends beyond this region with lower sensitivity so that the total area covered is 84 deg2. In this paper we describe the data, the data acquisition techniques and present the detection rates of the optically selected Virgo Cluster Catalogue (VCC). We detect 254 (34 per cent) of 750 VCC galaxies found within the survey boundary in at least one band and 171 galaxies are detected in all five bands. For the remainder of the galaxies we have measured strict upper limits for their FIR emission. The population of detected galaxies contains early as well as late types although the latter dominate the detection statistics. We have modelled 168 galaxies, showing no evidence of a strong synchrotron component in their FIR spectra, using a single-temperature modified blackbody spectrum with a fixed emissivity index (beta = 2). A study of the chi2 distribution indicates that this model is not appropriate in all cases, and this is supported by the FIR colours which indicate a spread in beta = 1-2. Statistical comparison of the dust mass and temperature distributions from 140 galaxies with chi2d.o.f. = 3 < 7.8 (95 per cent confidence level) shows that late types have typically colder, more massive dust reservoirs; the early-type dust masses have a mean of log[<M>/M&sun;] = 6.3 $\pm$ 0.3, while for late types log[<M>/M&sun;] = 7.1 $\pm$ 0.1. The late-type dust temperatures have a mean of <T> = 19.4 $\pm$ 0.2 K, while for the early types, <T> = 21.1 $\pm$ 0.8 K. Late-type galaxies in the cluster exhibit slightly lower dust masses than those in the field, but the cluster environment seems to have little effect on the bulk dust properties of early types. In future papers we will focus more on the scientific analysis of the catalogue (e.g. measuring FIR luminosity functions, dust mass functions and resolved gas and dust properties).},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the dust content of a large optical input sample of 910 early-type galaxies (ETG) in the Virgo cluster, also extending to the dwarf ETG, and examine the results in relation to those on the other cold ISM components.  Methods: We have searched for far-infrared emission in all galaxies in the input sample using the 250 mum image of the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS). This image covers a large fraction of the cluster with an area of ~55 square degrees. For the detected ETG we measured fluxes in five bands from 100 to 500 mum, and estimated the dust mass and temperature with modified black-body fits.  Results: Dust is detected above the completeness limit of 25.4 mJy at 250 mum in 46 ETG, 43 of which are in the optically complete part of the input sample. In addition, dust is present at fainter levels in another six ETG. We detect dust in the four ETG with synchrotron emission, including M 87. Dust appears to be much more concentrated than stars and more luminous ETG have higher dust temperatures. Considering only the optically complete input sample and correcting for the contamination by background galaxies, dust detection rates down to the 25.4 mJy limit are 17% for ellipticals, about 40% for lenticulars (S0 + S0a), and around 3% for dwarf ETG. Dust mass does not correlate clearly with stellar mass and is often much greater than expected for a passive galaxy in a closed-box model. The dust-to-stars mass ratio anticorrelates with galaxy luminosity, and for some dwarf ETG reaches values as high as for dusty late-type galaxies. In the Virgo cluster slow rotators appear more likely to contain dust than fast ones. Comparing the dust results with those on Hi there are only eight ETG detected both in dust and in Hi in the HeViCS area; 39 have dust but only an upper limit on Hi, and eight have Hi but only an upper limit on dust. The locations of these galaxies in the cluster are different, with the dusty ETG concentrated in the densest regions, while the Hi rich ETG are at the periphery.

	Abstract = {Context. We present the analysis of Halpha3, an Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey of galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) in the Coma supercluster.  Aims: Taking advantage of Halpha3, which provides the complete census of the recent star formation in HI-rich galaxies in the local universe, we explored the hypothesis that a morphological sequence of galaxies of progressively earlier type and lower gas-content exists in the neighborhood of a rich cluster of galaxies such as Coma, with a specific star formation activity that decreases with increasing local galaxy density and velocity dispersion.  Methods: By using the Halpha hydrogen recombination line as a tracer of the "instantaneous" star formation, complemented with optical colors from SDSS, we investigated the relationships between atomic neutral gas and newly formed stars in different local galaxy density intervals, for many morphological types, and over a wide range of stellar masses (109 to 1011.5 M&sun;).  Results: In the dwarf regime (8.5 < log (M*/M&sun;) < 9.5) we identify a four-step sequence of galaxies with progressively redder colors (corrected for dust extinction), i.e., of decreasing specific star formation, from (1) HI-rich late-type galaxies (LTGs) belonging to the blue cloud that exhibit extended plus nuclear star formation, (2) ~0.1 mag redder, HI-poor LTGs with nuclear star formation only, (3) ~0.35 mag redder, HI-poor galaxies without either extended or nuclear star formation, but with nuclear post-star-burst (PSB) signature, (4) ~ 0.5 mag redder early-type galaxies (ETGs) that belong to the red sequence, and show no gas or star formation on all scales. Along this sequence the quenching of the star formation proceeds radially outside-in. The progression toward redder colors found along this "morphological" (gas content) sequence is comparable to the one obtained from increasing the local galaxy density, from cosmic filaments (1 2), to the rich clusters (2 3 4).  Conclusions: In the dwarf regime we find evidence for an evolution of HI-rich LTGs into ETGs through HI-poor LTGs and PSB galaxies driven by the environment. We identify ram-pressure as the mechanism most likely responsible for this transformation. We conclude that infall of galaxies has proceeded for the last 7.5 Gyr, building up the Coma cluster at a rate of approximately 100 galaxies with log (M*/M&sun;) > 9.0 per Gyr.

@article{dubois13,
	Abstract = {In order to understand the physical mechanisms at work during the formation of massive early-type galaxies, we performed six zoomed hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of haloes in the mass range 4.3 × 1012 <= Mvir <= 8.0 × 1013 M&sun; at z = 0, using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. These simulations explore the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN), through jets powered by the accretion on to supermassive black holes on the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. In the absence of AGN feedback, large amounts of stars accumulate in the central galaxies to form overly massive, blue, compact and rotation-dominated galaxies. Powerful AGN jets transform the central galaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This morphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is driven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due to AGN feedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by accretion. For galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of stars deposited farther away from the centre increases, and galaxies have larger sizes. The accretion is also directly responsible for randomizing the stellar orbits, increasing the amount of dispersion over rotation of stars as a function of time. Finally, we find that our galaxies simulated with AGN feedback better match the observed scaling laws, such as the size-mass, velocity dispersion-mass, Fundamental Plane relations and slope of the total density profiles at z ˜ 0, from dynamical and strong lensing constraints.},

With the subsample of unperturbed field galaxies, we first identify the stellar mass as the scaling variable that traces the total molecular gas mass of galaxies better. We show that, on average, Hi-deficient galaxies are significantly offset (4sigma) from the M(H2) vs. Mstar relation for Hi-normal galaxies. We use the M(H2) vs. Mstar scaling relation to define the H2-deficiency parameter as the difference, on logarithmic scale, between the expected and observed molecular gas mass for a galaxy of given stellar mass. The H2-deficiency parameter shows a weak and scattered relation with the Hi-deficiency parameter, here taken as a proxy for galaxy interactions with the surrounding cluster environment. We also show that, as for the atomic gas, the extent of the molecular disc decreases with increasing Hi-deficiency. All together, these results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a lower molecular gas content than similar objects in the field. Our analysis indicates that ram pressure stripping is the physical process responsible for this molecular gas deficiency. The slope of the H2 - def vs. Hi - def relation is less than unity, while the D(Hi)/D(i) vs. Hi - def relation is steeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. Hi - def relation, thereby indicating that the molecular gas is removed less efficiently than the atomic gas. This result can be understood if the atomic gas is distributed on a relatively flat disc that is more extended than the stellar disc. It is thus less anchored to the gravitational potential well of the galaxy than the molecular gas phase, which is distributed on an exponential disc with a scalelength rCO ~= 0.2r24.5(g). There is a clear trend between the NUV-i colour index, which is a proxy for the specific star formation activity, and the H2-deficiency parameter, which suggests that molecular gas removal quenches the activity of star formation. This causes galaxies migrate from the blue cloud to the green valley and, eventually, to the red sequence. The total gas-consumption timescale of gas deficient cluster galaxies is comparable to that of isolated, unperturbed systems. The total gas depletion timescale determined by considering the recycled fraction is taugas,R ~= 3.0-3.3 Gyr, which is significantly larger than the typical timescale for total gas removal in a ram pressure stripping process, indicated by recent hydrodynamical simulations to be tauRP~= 1.5 Gyr. The comparison of these timescales suggests that ram pressure, rather than a simple stop of the infall of pristine gas from the halo, will be the dominant process driving the future evolution of these cluster galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We study the role of the environment on galaxy evolution using a sample of 868 galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in its surrounding regions that are selected from the GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS) with the purpose of understanding the origin of the red sequence in dense environments. The sample spans a wide range in morphological types (from dwarf ellipticals to Im and BCD) and stellar masses (107 ≲ Mstar ≲ 1011.5M&sun;). We collected multifrequency data covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum for most of the galaxies, including UV, optical, mid- and far-infrared imaging data, as well as optical and HI spectroscopic data. We first identify the different dynamical substructures that compose the Virgo cluster, and we calculate the local density of galaxies using different methods. We then study the distribution of galaxies belonging to the red sequence, the green valley, and the blue cloud within the different cluster substructures or as a function of galaxy density. Our analysis indicates that all the most massive galaxies (Mstar ≳ 1011M&sun;) are slow rotators and are the dominant galaxies of the different cluster substructures, which are generally associated with a diffuse X-ray emission. They are probably the result of major merging events that occurred at early epochs, as also indicated by their very old stellar populations. Slow rotators of lower stellar mass (108.5 ≲ Mstar ≲ 1011M&sun;) are also preferentially located within the different high-density substructures of the cluster. Their position in the velocity space indicates that they are virialised within the cluster; thus, they are Virgo members since its formation. They have been shaped by gravitational perturbations occurring within the infalling groups that later form the cluster (pre-processing). On the contrary, low-mass star-forming systems are extremely rare in the inner regions of the Virgo cluster A, where the density of the intergalactic medium is at its maximum. Our ram pressure stripping models consistently indicate that these star-forming systems can be rapidly deprived of their interstellar medium during their interaction with the intergalactic medium. The lack of gas quenches their star-formation activity transforming them into quiescent dwarf ellipticals. This mild transformation does not perturb the kinematic properties of these galaxies, which still have rotation curves typical of star-forming systems.

	Abstract = {Neutral hydrogen represents the major observable baryonic constituent of galaxies that fuels the formation of stars through transformation of molecular hydrogen. The emission of the hydrogen recombination line Halpha is the most direct tracer of the process that transforms gas (fuel) into stars. We continue to present Halpha3 (acronym for Halpha - alphaalpha), an extensive Halpha+[NII] narrow-band imaging campaign of galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA), using the instrumentation available at the San Pedro Martir (SPM) observatory (Mexico). In 48 nights since 2011 we were able to carry out the Halpha imaging observations of 724 galaxies in the region of the Coma supercluster 10h < RA < 16h ; 24$\,^{\circ}$ < Dec < 28$\,^{\circ}$ and 3900 <cz< 9000 km s-1. Of these, 603 are selected from the ALFALFA and constitute a 97% complete sample. They provide for the first time a complete census of the massive star formation properties of local gas-rich galaxies belonging to different environments (cluster vs. filaments), morphological types (spirals vs. dwarf Irr), over a wide range of stellar mass (~ 108 - 1011.5M&sun;) in the Coma supercluster. The present Paper V provides Halpha data and derived star formation rates for the observed galaxies.  The data available for the 724 galaxies are given in three tables, which are partially listed in the Appendix. The full tables, the Atlas, and the FITS images of the 724 targeted galaxies are distributed via http://goldmine.mib.infn.it/ (Gavazzi et al. 2003, 2014) under the section project/papers.},

	Abstract = {We present new Halpha+[NII] imaging data of late-type galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey aimed at studying the star formation properties of a K-band-selected, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. The Halpha+[NII] data are corrected for [NII] contamination and dust attenuation using different recipes based on the Balmer decrement and the 24 mum luminosities. We show that the Halpha luminosities derived with different corrections give consistent results only whenever the uncertainty on the estimate of the Balmer decrement is sigma [C(Hbeta)] <= 0.1. We used these data to derive the star formation rate of the late-type galaxies of the sample and compare these estimates to those determined using independent monochromatic tracers (far-UV, radio continuum) or the output of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. This comparison suggests that the 24 mum based dust extinction correction for the Halpha data might not be universal and that it should be used with caution in all objects with a low star formation activity, where dust heating can be dominated by the old stellar population. Furthermore, because of the sudden truncation of the star formation activity of cluster galaxies occurring after their interaction with the surrounding environment, the stationarity conditions required to transform monochromatic fluxes into star formation rates might not always be satisfied in tracers other than the Halpha luminosity. In a similar way, the parametrisation of the star formation history generally used in SED fitting codes might not be adequate for these recently interacting systems. We then use the derived star formation rates to study the star formation rate luminosity distribution and the typical scaling relations of the late-type galaxies of the HRS. We observe a systematic decrease of the specific star formation rate with increasing stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, and metallicity. We also observe an increase of the asymmetry and smoothness parameters measured in the Halpha-band with increasing specific star formation rate, probably induced by an increase of the contribution of giant HII regions to the Halpha luminosity function in star-forming low-luminosity galaxies.

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the influence of stellar bulges on the star formation and morphology of disc galaxies that suffer from ram pressure. Several tree-SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations have been carried out to study the dependence of the star formation rate on the mass and size of a stellar bulge. In addition, different strengths of ram pressure and different alignments of the disc with respect to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are applied.  Methods: The simulations were carried out with the combined N-body/hydrodynamic code GADGET-2 with radiative cooling and a recipe for star formation. The same galaxy with different bulge sizes was used to accomplish 31 simulations with varying inclination angles and surrounding gas densities of 10-27g cm-3 and 10-28g cm-3. For all the simulations a relative velocity of 1000 km s-1 for the galaxies and an initial gas temperature for the ICM of 107K were applied. Besides galaxies flying edge-on and face-on through the surrounding gas, various disc tilt angles in between were used. To allow a comparison, the galaxies with the different bulges were also evolved in isolation to contrast the star formation rates. Furthermore, the influence of different disc gas mass fractions has been investigated.  Results: As claimed in previous works, when ram pressure is acting on a galaxy, the star formation rate (SFR) is enhanced and rises up to four times with increasing ICM density compared to galaxies that evolve in isolation. However, a bulge suppresses the SFR when the same ram pressure is applied. Consequently, fewer new stars are formed because the SFR can be lowered by up to 2M&sun; yr-1. Furthermore, the denser the surrounding gas, the more interstellar medium (ISM) is stripped. While at an ICM density of 10-28g cm-3 about 30% of the ISM is stripped, the galaxy is almost completely (more than 90%) stripped when an ICM density of 10-27g cm-3 is applied. But again, a bulge prevents the stripping of the ISM and reduces the amount being stripped by up to 10%. Thereby, fewer stars are formed in the wake if the galaxy contains a bulge. The dependence of the SFR on the disc tilt angle is not very pronounced. Merely a slight trend of decreasing star formation with increasing inclination angle can be determined. Furthermore, with increasing disc tilt angles, less gas is stripped and therefore fewer stars are formed in the wake. Reducing the disc gas mass fraction results in a lower SFR when the galaxies evolve in vacuum. On the other hand, the enhancement of the SFR in case of acting ram pressure is less pronounced with increasing gas mass fraction. Moreover, the fractional amount of stripped gas does not depend on the gas mass fraction.},

	Abstract = {Aims:The influence of a time-varying ram pressure on spiral galaxies in clusters is explored with a new simulation method based on the N-body SPH/tree code GADGET.  Methods: We have adapted the code to describe the interaction of two different gas phases, the diffuse hot intracluster medium (ICM) and the denser and colder interstellar medium (ISM). Both the ICM and ISM components are introduced as SPH particles. As a galaxy arrives on a highly radial orbit from outskirts to cluster center, it crosses the ICM density peak and experiences a time-varying wind. Results: Depending on the duration and intensity of the ISM-ICM interaction, early and late type galaxies in galaxy clusters with either a large or small ICM distribution are found to show different stripping efficiencies, amounts of reaccretion of the extra-planar ISM, and final masses. We compare the numerical results with analytical approximations of different complexity and indicate the limits of the Gunn & Gott simple stripping formula.  Conclusions: Our investigations emphasize the role of the galactic orbital history to the stripping amount. We discuss the contribution of ram pressure stripping to the origin of the ICM and its metallicity. We propose gas accumulations like tails, filaments, or ripples to be responsible for stripping in regions with low overall ICM occurrence.

@article{roediger05,
	Abstract = {Galaxies in clusters and groups moving through the intracluster or intragroup medium (abbreviated ICM for both) are expected to lose at least a part of their interstellar medium (ISM) by the ram pressure they experience. We perform high resolution 2D hydrodynamical simulations of face-on ram pressure stripping (RPS) of disk galaxies to compile a comprehensive parameter study varying galaxy properties (mass, vertical structure of the gas disk) and covering a large range of ICM conditions, reaching from high density environments like in cluster centres to low density environments typical for cluster outskirts or groups. We find that the ICM-ISM interaction proceeds in three phases: firstly the instantaneous stripping phase, secondly the dynamic intermediate phase, thirdly the quasi-stable continuous viscous stripping phase. In the first phase (time scale 20 to 200~Myr) the outer part of the gas disk is displaced but only partially unbound. In the second phase (10 times as long as the first phase) a part of the displaced gas falls back (about 10% of the initial gas mass) despite the constant ICM wind, but most displaced gas is now unbound. In the third phase the galaxy continues to lose gas at a rate of about 1~M&sun;~~yr-1 by turbulent viscous stripping. We find that the stripping efficiency depends slightly on the Mach number of the flow, however, the main parameter is the ram pressure. The stripping efficiency does not depend on the vertical structure and thickness of the gas disk. We discuss uncertainties in the classic estimate of the stripping radius of Grunn & Gott (1972, ApJ, 176, 1), which compares the ram pressure to the gravitational restoring force. In addition, we adapt the estimate used by Mori & Burkert (2000, ApJ, 538, 559) for spherical galaxies, namely the comparison of the central pressure with ram pressure. We find that the latter estimate predicts the radius and mass of the gas disk remaining at the end of the second phase very well, and better than the Grunn & Gott (1972, ApJ, 176, 1) criterion. From our simulations we conclude that gas disks of galaxies in high density environments are heavily truncated or even completely stripped, but also the gas disks of galaxies in low density environments are disturbed by the flow and back-falling material, so that they should also be pre-processed.},

@article{schulz01,
	Abstract = {We present new three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations of the ram pressure stripping of disc galaxies via interaction with a hot intracluster medium (ICM). The simulations were carried with the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, adaptive mesh `hydra' code (SPH-AP3M), with model galaxies consisting of gas and stellar disc components and dark haloes. The simulations also include radiative cooling, which is important for keeping the warm, diffuse gas of moderate density from being unrealistically heated by the ICM. We examine the role that wind velocity, density and galaxy tilt play in gas stripping. We include cases with lower ram pressures than other recent studies. In accord with previous studies, we find that low column density gas is promptly removed from the outer disc. However, we also find that not all of the gas stripped from the disc escapes immediately from the halo, some of material can linger for times of order 108yr. We use a simple analytic model to demonstrate that gas elements in the ICM wind feel an effective potential with a minimum displaced downstream from the halo centre. The onset of the ICM wind has a profound effect on the disc gas that is not immediately stripped. This remnant disc is displaced relative to the halo centre and compressed. This can trigger gravitational instability and the formation of numerous flocculent spirals. These waves transport angular momentum outward, resulting in further compression of the inner disc and the formation of a prominent gas ring. This `annealing' process makes the inner disc, which contains much of the total gas mass, resistant to further stripping, but presumably susceptible to global starbursts. Spirals in the outer disc stretch, shear and are eventually stripped on time-scales of a few times 108yr, after which time, mass and angular momentum loss effectly cease. For inclined galaxies, these effects are considerably modified over the same time-scale. The amount of mass loss is reduced. In addition, we find that a higher galaxy tilt couples the wind and the rotating disc, and produces a higher degree of angular momentum removal. Temperature and line-of-sight velocity maps from several of the simulations are presented for comparison with observation. When the mass loss and annealing processes go to completion, we find that the total amount of mass lost from a fixed target galaxy is well-fitted by a simple power-law function of a dimensionless parameter that combines the ram pressure and internal properties of the galaxy. Ramifications for the cluster galaxy evolution are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Context. We present the analysis of the galaxy structural parameters from Halpha3, an Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey of ~800 galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) in the Local supercluster, including the Virgo cluster, and in the Coma supercluster.  Aims: Taking advantage of Halpha3, which provides the complete census of the recent star-forming, HI-rich galaxies in the local universe, we aim to investigate the structural parameters of the young (<10 Myr) and the old (>1 Gyr) stellar populations. By comparing the sizes of these stellar components, we investigated the spatial scale on which galaxies are growing at the present cosmological epoch and the role of the environment in quenching the star-formation activity.  Methods: We computed the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness (CAS) structural parameters for recently born and old stars. To quantify the sizes we computed half-light radii and a new parameter dubbed EW/r based on the half-light radius of the Halpha equivalent width map. To highlight the environmental perturbation, we adopt an updated calibration of the HI-deficiency parameter (DefHI) that we use to divide the sample in unperturbed galaxies (DefHI <= 0.3) and perturbed galaxies (DefHI > 0.3).  Results: The concentration index computed in the r band depends on the stellar mass and on the Hubble type these variables are related because most massive galaxies are bulge dominated therefore highly concentrated. Going toward later spirals and irregulars the concentration index and the mass decrease along with the bulge-to-disk ratio. Blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) are an exception because they have similar mass, but they are more concentrated than dwarf irregulars. The asymmetry and the clumpiness increase along the spiral sequence up to Sc-Sd, but they decrease going in the dwarf regime, where the light distribution is smooth and more symmetric. When measured on Halpha images, the CAS parameters show no obvious correlations with Hubble type. Irrespective of whether we used the ratio between effective radii or the EW/r parameter, we found that the concentration index is the main parameter that describes the current growth of isolated galaxies but, for a fixed concentration, the stellar mass plays a second-order role. At the present epoch, massive galaxies are growing inside-out, conversely, the dwarfs are growing on the scale of their already assembled mass.

	Abstract = {Context. We present the analysis of Halpha3, an Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey of 409 galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) in the Local Supercluster, including the Virgo cluster, in the region 11h < RA < 16h ; 4o < Dec < 16$\,^{\circ}$; 350 < cz < 2000 km s-1.  Aims: Taking advantage of Halpha3, which provides the complete census of the recent massive star formation rate (SFR) in HI-rich galaxies in the local Universe and of ancillary optical data from SDSS we explore the relations between the stellar mass, the HI mass, and the current, massive SFR of nearby galaxies in the Virgo cluster. We compare these with those of isolated galaxies in the Local Supercluster, and we investigate the role of the environment in shaping the star formation properties of galaxies at the present cosmological epoch.  Methods: By using the Halpha hydrogen recombination line as a tracer of recent star formation, we investigated the relationships between atomic neutral gas and newly formed stars in different environments (cluster and field), for many morphological types (spirals and dwarfs), and over a wide range of stellar masses (107.5 to 1011.5 M&sun;). To quantify the degree of environmental perturbation, we adopted an updated calibration of the HI deficiency parameter which we used to divide the sample into three classes: unperturbed galaxies (DefHI <= 0.3), perturbed galaxies (0.3 < DefHI < 0.9), and highly perturbed galaxies (DefHI >= 0.9).  Results: Studying the mean properties of late-type galaxies in the Local Supercluster, we find that galaxies in increasing dense local galaxy conditions (or decreasing projected angular separation from M 87) show a significant decrease in the HI content and in the mean specific SFR, along with a progressive reddening of their stellar populations. The gradual quenching of the star formation occurs outside-in, consistently with the predictions of the ram pressure model. Once considered as a whole, the Virgo cluster is effective in removing neutral hydrogen from galaxies, and this perturbation is strong enough to appreciably reduce the SFR of its entire galaxy population.  Conclusions: An estimate of the present infall rate of 300-400 galaxies per Gyr in the Virgo cluster is obtained from the number of existing HI-rich late-type systems, assuming 200-300 Myr as the time scale for HI ablation. If the infall process has been acting at a constant rate, this would imply that the Virgo cluster has formed approximately 2 Gyr ago, consistently with the idea that Virgo is in a young state of dynamical evolution.

	Abstract = {We use three-dimensional SPH/N-body simulations to study ram pressure stripping of gas from spiral galaxies orbiting in clusters. We find that the analytic expectation of Gunn & Gott, relating the gravitational restoring force provided by the disc to the ram pressure force, provides a good approximation to the radius at which gas will be stripped from a galaxy. However, at small radii it is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component. A spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster, such as Coma, will have its gaseous disc truncated to ~4kpc, thus losing ~80per cent of its diffuse gas mass. The time-scale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossing time ~10^7yr. Galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclined to the direction of motion through the intracluster medium, will lose significantly less gas. We conclude that ram pressure alone is insufficient to account for the rapid and widespread truncation of star formation observed in cluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of Sabs to S0s that is necessary to explain the Butcher-Oemler effect.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how ram pressure of intragroup and intracluster medium can influence the spatial and temporal variations of star formation (SF) of disc galaxies with halo masses (Mh) ranging from 1010 to 1012 M&sun; (i.e. from dwarf irregular to Milky Way-type) in groups and clusters with 1013 <= Mh/M&sun; <= 1015 by using numerical simulations with a new model for time-varying ram pressure. The long-term evolution of SF rates and Halpha morphologies corresponding to the distributions of star-forming regions are particularly investigated for different model parameters. The principal results are as follows. Whether ram pressure can enhance or reduce SF depends on Mh of disc galaxies and inclination angles of gas discs with respect to their orbital directions for a given orbit and a given environment. For example, SF can be moderately enhanced in disc galaxies with Mh = 1012 M&sun; at the pericentre passages in a cluster with Mh = 1014 M&sun; whereas it can be completely shut down (`quenching') for low-mass discs with Mh = 1010 M&sun;. Ram pressure can reduce the Halpha-to-optical-disc-size ratios of discs and the level of the reduction depends on Mh and orbits of disc galaxies for a given environment. Disc galaxies under strong ram pressure show characteristic Halpha morphologies such as ring-like, one-sided and crescent-like distributions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the physical properties of molecular hydrogen (H2) in isolated and interacting disc galaxies with different masses and Hubble types by using chemodynamical simulations with H2 formation on dust grains and dust growth and destruction in interstellar medium. We particularly focus on the dependences of H2 gas mass fractions (f_H_2), spatial distributions of H I and H2, and local H2-scaling relations on initial halo masses (Mh), baryonic fractions (fbary), gas mass fractions (fg), and Hubble types. The principal results are as follows. The final f_H_2 can be larger in disc galaxies with higher Mh, fbary, and fg. Some low-mass disc models with Mh smaller than 1010 M&sun; show extremely low f_H_2 and thus no/little star formation, even if initial fg is quite large (>0.9). Big galactic bulges can severely suppress the formation of H2 from H I on dust grains whereas strong stellar bars cannot only enhance f_H_2 but also be responsible for the formation of H2-dominated central rings. The projected radial distributions of H2 are significantly more compact than those of H I and the simulated radial profiles of H2-to-H I-ratios (Rmol) follow roughly R-1.5 in Milky Way-type disc models. Galaxy interaction can significantly increase f_H_2 and total H2 mass in disc galaxies. The local surface mass densities of H2 can be correlated with those of dust in a galaxy. The observed correlation between Rmol and gas pressure (R_mol ∝ P_g^{0.92}) can be well reproduced in the simulated disc galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function of ultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. In the (NUV-r)0.1 versus Mr,0.1 galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The (NUV-r)0.1 color distribution at each Mr,0.1 is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity, with a distinct blue peak visible up to Mr,0.1~-23. The r0.1-band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint-end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one-quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust, with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low-mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of ~1010.5 Msolar, galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.},

@article{dekel06,
	Abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass ~3 × 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z~ 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z~ 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock<~ 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>=Mshock haloes preferentially at z>= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L > L* galaxies. At z < 2, in M > Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z~ 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

@article{springel05,
	Abstract = {We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.},

A similar and non-Gaussian distribution is found for the distribution of H I deficiencies of both faint galaxies and brighter spirals, and populations of galaxies with normal abundances of interstellar H I, and those of gas poor objects exhibiting a late-type morphology, are both noted. One-sixth of the sample within the Virgo 5-degree core have lost more than 90 percent by mass of their original neutral hydrogen, and three quarters of the galaxies found within 2.5 degrees of M87 are H I poor by more than a factor of three. The most deficient galaxies are also found to be the ones with the smallest ratios of H I to optical disk size, and H I poor galaxies are redder than normal, indicating that star formation has been quenched.},

	Abstract = {In the first paper of this series we used HI observations of the 19 brightest spirals in Coma to analyze the dynamical state of the cluster. In this paper we present the detailed HI distribution and kinematics of the spirals that were detected in HI, and radio continuum data for a sample of star forming and post starburst galaxies in Coma. We discuss the importance of ICM-ISM interactions to explain the observed HI morphology. A rough comparison of observed HI sizes with predicted HI sizes from simulations by Abadi et al. (\cite{Abadi99}) gives reasonable agreement. We use the results on radio continuum emission to estimate the star formation rate in the PSB galaxies we pointed at. The radio continuum emission in the 11 so called post starburst galaxies, identified by Caldwell et al. (\cite{Caldwell93}) in the cluster, is weak. Eight of the 11 were not detected down to a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.6 mJy. This sets an upper limit to the star formation rate in these galaxies of less than 0.2 Msun,yr-1. The three detected post starburst galaxies have a star formation rate of less than one solar mass per year. Thus none of the post starburst galaxies in Coma are dust enshrouded starbursts.

@article{bravo-alfaro00,
	Abstract = {We have obtained 21 cm images of 19 spiral galaxies in the Coma cluster, using the VLA in its C and D configurations. The sample selection was based on morphology, brightness, and optical diameters of galaxies within one Abell radius (1.2d). The H I-detected, yet deficient galaxies show a strong correlation in their H I properties with projected distance from the cluster center. The most strongly H I-deficient (DefH I>0.4) galaxies are located inside a radius of 30' (~0.6 Mpc) from the center of Coma, roughly the extent of the central X-ray emission. These central galaxies show clear asymmetries in their H I distribution and/or shifts between the optical and 21 cm positions. Another 12 spirals were not detected in H I with typical H I mass upper limits of 108 Msolar. Seven of the 12 nondetections are located in the central region of Coma, roughly within 30' from the center. The other nondetections are to the east and southwest of the center. We looked for seven so-called blue disk galaxies in Coma in H I and detected six. These galaxies are relatively close to the central region of Coma. The nondetected one is the closest to the center. The six detected blue galaxies are mildly H I deficient. We did a more sensitive search for H I from 11 of the 15 known poststarburst galaxies in Coma. None were detected with typical H I mass limits between 3 and 7x107 Msolar. Our results present and enhance a picture already familiar for well-studied clusters. H I poor galaxies (deficient ones and nondetections) are concentrated toward the center of the cluster. The H I morphology of the central galaxies with optical disks extending beyond the H I disks is unique to cluster environments and strongly suggests an interaction with the intergalactic medium (IGM). A new result in Coma is the clumpy distribution of gas deficiency. In the cluster center the deficient galaxies are to the east while the nondetections are to the west. In the outer parts the gas rich galaxies are north of Coma, nondetected spirals are found in the NGC 4944 group to the east, and the NGC 4839 group is to the southwest. This supports recent findings that merging of groups is ongoing in the center of Coma, farther out the NGC 4944 and NGC 4839 must have passed at least once through the core, and the galaxies to the north have yet to fall in.},

	Abstract = {Photometry of the integrated Halpha emission in a large sample of field spiral and irregular galaxies has been used to obtain quantitative estimates of the total star formation rate (SFR) in the galaxies. The photoionization properties of a stellar population have been modeled for a variety of choices for the initial mass function (IMF). Excellent agreement with the observed galaxy colors and Halpha emission is obtained with models using an IMF slope close  to Salpeter's original value. The extinction-corrected star formation rates are large, as high as 20 M_sun; yr-1 in giant Sc galaxies. The current rates in late-type galaxies are comparable to the past rates averaged over the age of the disk. Little evidence is found for a strong correlation between the SFR  and average gas density. Comparison of the present SFRs with the remaining supply of interstellar gas yields consumption time scales of only a few times 109 years in most cases.},

@article{lake98,
	Abstract = {We have simulated disk galaxies undergoing continual bombardment by other galaxies in a rich cluster. ``Galaxy harassment'' leads to dramatic evolution of smaller disk galaxies and provides an extremely effective mechanism for fueling a central quasar. Within a few billion years after a small disk galaxy enters the cluster environment, up to 90% of its gas can be driven into the inner 500 pc. Up to half of the mass can be transferred in a burst lasting just 100-200 Myr. This transport of gas to the center of galaxy is far more efficient than any mechanism proposed before. Galaxy harassment was first proposed to explain the disturbance of blue galaxies in clusters seen at z >~ 0.3, known as the ``Butcher-Oemler effect.'' Quasars at the same redshifts lie in more clustered environments than those at lower redshifts. Recent Hubble Space Telescope observations find that roughly half of all observed quasar host galaxies are fainter than L*, with many of these less luminous hosts occurring at redshifts z >~ 0.3. We examine five quasars that are claimed to have low-luminosity hosts and find that three are in rich clusters of galaxies; the fourth may be in a cluster, but the evidence for this is marginal. The environment of the fifth has not been studied.},

	Abstract = {We performed Halpha imaging observations of 22 luminous infrared galaxies to investigate how the distribution of star-forming regions in these galaxies is related to galaxy interactions. Based on correlation diagrams between Halpha flux and continuum emission for individual galaxies, a sequence for the distribution of star-forming regions was found: very compact (~100 pc) nuclear starbursts with almost no star-forming activity in the outer regions (type 1), dominant nuclear starbursts <~1 kpc in size with a negligible contribution from the outer regions (type 2), nuclear starbursts >~1 kpc in size with a significant contribution from the outer regions (type 3), and extended starbursts with relatively faint nuclei (type 4). These classes of star-forming regions were found to be strongly related to global star-forming properties, such as star formation efficiency, far-infrared color, and dust extinction. There was a clear tendency for the objects with more compact distributions of star-forming regions to show a higher star formation efficiency and hotter far-infrared color. An appreciable fraction of the sample objects were dominated by extended starbursts (type 4), which is unexpected in the standard scenario of interaction-induced starburst galaxies. We also found that the distribution of star-forming regions was weakly but clearly related to galaxy morphology: severely disturbed objects had a more concentrated distribution of star-forming regions. This suggests that the properties of galaxy interactions, such as dynamical phase and orbital parameters, play a more important role than the internal properties of progenitor galaxies, such as dynamical structure or gas mass fraction. We also discuss the evolution of the distribution of star-forming regions in interacting galaxies.},

	Abstract = {H-alpha emission-line and IRAS far-IR observations of interacting spiral and irregular galaxies are here used to assess the influence of interactions on their global star-formation rates. Two samples of interacting galaxies were observed: a complete sample of close pairs, and an Arp atlas sample of peculiar systems. When compared to a control sample of single galaxies, both samples of interacting systems exhibit systematically higher levels of H-alpha and infrared emission on average, and a larger dispersion in emission properties. Emission levels in the very active system are much more strongly correlated with the properties of the interaction than with the internal properties of the galaxies themselves. Strong disk emission is almost always accompanied by unusually strong nuclear activity. Simple star-formation burst models can reproduce the observed H-alpha equivalent widths and broadband colors of most of the galaxies. The bursts are relatively short (few times 10 million yr) and rarely involve more than 1-2 percent of a galaxy's total mass.},

	Abstract = {The authors have obtained spectra of the nuclei of 161 interacting spirals, and compared their properties to those of a complete sample of field spirals. They find that the interacting systems show: (1) Significantly higher levels of emission, in equivalent width and luminosity. (2) More active and extensive nuclear star formation, over all Hubble types. (3) More frequent Seyfert nuclei among close pairs, but fewer among very disturbed (post-encounter) systems. (4) Fewer low-ionization nuclei, which have presumably been turned into Seyferts or masked by nuclear H II regions. The higher incidence of Seyferts in the complete sample supports the notion of central compact objects' being common but normally quiescent in luminous spirals, while their deficiency among distorted pairs suggests that these objects may become gas starved.},

	Abstract = {The authors have used large aperture Halpha photometry of 65 spiral galaxies in the Cancer, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters to compare the ionized-gas contents and star-formation rates in cluster and field spirals. Overall, the authors do not observe any significant deficiency of Halpha emission in the cluster members. Emission strength correlates strongly with integrated galaxy colors, but only weakly with H I content. All three clusters contain several galaxies with unusually strong Halpha emission, including several H I-poor objects in Coma and A1367. Thus, spirals which appear "anemic" in their morphology or exhibit weak Halpha emission are not necessarily H I poor; conversely, H I poor spirals can show strong Halpha emission, indicating relatively high current star-formation rates. Gas depletion time scales for some objects in the core of Coma are significantly shorter than the field, indicating rapid stellar and gaseous evolution.},

	Abstract = {We have examined the radial distribution of H II regions in the rectified planes of 37 galaxies. They group themselves into three broad classes: those with continually decreasing density outward, those with oscillating density, and those with doughnut-shaped density distributions. Generally, the second class is made up largely of SB galaxies, and the last is mostly populated by early Hubble types. A correlation is also found with absolute magnitude, which increases along the sequence given above. Most galaxies' outer H II region distributions show an exponential decrease in density, with a slope that is strongly correlated with Hubble type and absolute magnitude. We also find a correlation between Hubble type and the size of H II region density fluctuations, in the sense that later Hubble types show smaller differences in H II region density.},

	Abstract = {To study the distribution of star formation and dust emission within nearby galaxies, we measured five morphological parameters in the 3.6- and 24-mum wavebands for 65 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) and eight galaxies that were serendipitously observed by SINGS. The morphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the Hubble sequence, including statistically significant differences between S0/a-Sab and Sc-Sd galaxies. Early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact, centralized, symmetric sources in the 24-mum band, while late-type galaxies are generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. These results suggest that the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulges also lead to more centralized 24-mum dust emission. Several phenomena, such as strong nuclear star formation, Seyfert activity, or outer ring structures, may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at 24 mum. We also note that the 24-mum morphologies of Sdm-Im galaxies are quite varied, with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric but others appearing diffuse and asymmetric. These variations reflect the wide variation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at other wavelengths. The variations in the 24-mum morphological parameters across the Hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in other tracers of the ISM and in stellar emission. However, the 24-mum morphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match the morphological parameters measured in the stellar wavebands. This implies that the distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to the distribution of stellar emission.},

	Abstract = {Observed galaxies with high stellar masses or in dense environments have low specific star formation rates, i.e. they are quenched. Based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a prescription where quenching occurs in regions dominated by hot (>105.4 K) gas, we argue that this hot gas quenching in haloes >1012 M&sun; drives both mass quenching (i.e. central quenching) and environment quenching (i.e. satellite quenching). These simulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching, halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo centre. Mass quenching is independent of environment because ˜1012-1013 M&sun; `mass quenching haloes' inhabit a large range of environments. On the other hand, environment quenching is independent of stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense environments as satellites of groups and clusters. As in observations, the quenched fraction of satellites increases with halo mass and decreases with distance to the centre of the group or cluster. We investigate pre-processing in group haloes, ejected former satellites, and hot gas that extends beyond the virial radius. The agreement of our model with key observational trends suggests that hot gas in massive haloes plays a leading role in quenching low-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The instantaneous H I content of galaxies is thought to be governed by recent accretion and environment. We examine these effects within a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic galactic outflow model that reproduces basic observed trends of H I in galaxies. We show that this model reproduces the observed H I mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the H I richness (M_{H I}/M*) versus local galaxy density. For satellite galaxies in massive ( ≳ 1012 M&sun;) haloes, the H I richness distribution is bimodal and the median drops towards the largest halo masses. The depletion time-scale of H I entering a massive halo is more rapid, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows little variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests that, up to the halo mass scales probed here ( ≲ 1014 M&sun;), star formation is mainly attenuated by starvation, but H I is additionally removed by stripping once a hot gaseous halo is present. In low-mass haloes, the H I richness of satellites is independent of radius, while in very massive haloes they become gas-poor towards the centre, confirming the increasing strength of the stripping with halo mass. Mergers somewhat increase the H I richness and its scatter about the mean relation, tracking the metallicity in a way consistent with it arising from inflow fluctuations, while star formation is significantly boosted relative to H I.},

	Abstract = {We present photometry of images from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) of over 400 million sources detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a ``forced photometry'' technique, using measured SDSS source positions, star-galaxy classification, and galaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the WISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code, working on our ``unWISE'' coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands, so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero given our uncertainties. However, for many sources we get 3sigma or 4sigma measurements; these sources would not be reported by the ``official'' WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at the catalog level. The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent set of sources between SDSS and WISE, taking advantage of the resolution and depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements in our photometry. Our results, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me.},

@article{yang07,
	Abstract = {We use a modified version of the halo-based group finder developed by Yang et al. to select galaxy groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR4). In the first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers of potential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. Using an iterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the average mass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is then used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership in redshift space. Finally, each individual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on its characteristic luminosity and the other based on its characteristic stellar mass. Applying the group finder to the SDSS DR4, we obtain 301,237 groups in a broad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. We use detailed mock galaxy catalogs constructed for the SDSS DR4 to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination by interlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. This paper is the first in a series and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of the group finder, and the basic properties of the group catalog (e.g., the mass-to-light ratios, the halo mass-to-stellar mass ratios). The group catalogs including the membership of the groups are available on request.},

@article{balogh16,
	Abstract = {We present an analysis of galaxies in groups and clusters at 0.8 < z < 1.2, from the GCLASS and GEEC2 spectroscopic surveys. We compute a `conversion fraction' fconvert that represents the fraction of galaxies that were prematurely quenched by their environment. For massive galaxies, Mstar > 1010.3 M&sun;, we find fconvert ˜ 0.4 in the groups and ˜0.6 in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at z = 0. This means the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final star formation quenching is tp ˜ 2 Gyr. This is substantially longer than the estimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero once it starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which little differential evolution occurs. In contrast with local observations we find evidence that this delay time-scale may depend on stellar mass, with tp approaching tHubble for Mstar ˜ 109.5 M&sun;. The result suggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today, but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with a simple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. Instead, we find the data are well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to `overconsumption', the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation and expulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion. Dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newly accreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at z = 1.},

@article{dale02,
	Abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter data are used to solidify and to extend to long wavelengths the empirical calibration of the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal star-forming galaxies. As was found by Dale and coworkers in 2001, a single parameter family, characterized by fnu(60mum)/fnu(100mum), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy SEDs observed by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite and Infrared Space Observatory from 3 to 100 mum. However, predictions based on the first-generation models at longer wavelengths (122-850 mum) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smaller fnu(60mum)/fnu(100mum), or alternatively, for weaker global interstellar radiation fields. After slightly modifying the far-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of the radiation field intensity to better match the long-wavelength data, a suite of SEDs from 3 mum to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. Results from relevant applications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometric redshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae for recovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates in galaxies. Regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared SEDs are not well described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dust masses can be grossly inadequate. The improved model presented herein is used to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.},

	Abstract = {Using data from four deep fields (COSMOS, AEGIS, ECDFS, and CDFN), we study the correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at z < 1.1. To accurately estimate the galaxy SFR, we use the deepest available Spitzer/MIPS 24 and Herschel/PACS data sets. We distinguish group environments (Mhalo ˜ 1012.5-14.2 M&sun;) based on the available deep X-ray data and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. We confirm that the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies is not a linear relation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses (M* > 1010.4-10.6 M&sun;), across all environments. At high redshift (0.5 < z < 1.1), the MS varies little with environment. At low redshift (0.15 < z < 0.5), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean MS towards the region of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-dense environments. We find that the flattening of the MS towards low SFR is due to an increased fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies at high masses. Instead, the deviation of group galaxies from the MS at low redshift is caused by a large fraction of red disc-dominated galaxies which are not present in the lower density environments. Our results suggest that above a mass threshold (˜1010.4-1010.6 M&sun;) stellar mass, morphology and environment act together in driving the evolution of the star formation activity towards lower level. The presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes are already in place beyond z ˜1. The environmental effects appear, instead, at lower redshifts and have a long time-scale.},

	Abstract = {We present a newly measured X-ray temperature function of galaxy clusters using a complete flux-limited sample of 61 clusters. The sample is constructed with the total survey area of 8.14 steradians and the flux limit of 1.99x 10-11 ergs s-1 cm-2 in the 0.1-2.4 keV band. X-ray temperatures and fluxes of the sample clusters were accurately measured with ASCA and ROSAT data. The derived temperature function covers an unprecedentedly wide temperature range of 1.4-11 keV. By fitting these data with theoretically predicted temperature functions given by the Press-Schechter formalism together with a recent formation approximation and the CDM power spectrum, we obtained tight and individual constraints on Omega_m ,0 and sigma_8 . We also employed the Formation-Epoch model in which the distribution in the formation epoch of clusters as well as the temperature evolution are taken into account, showing significantly different results. Systematics caused by the uncertainty in the mass-temperature relation are studied and found to be as large as the statistical errors.},

@article{bohringer00,
	Abstract = {In the construction of an X-ray-selected sample of galaxy clusters for cosmological studies, we have assembled a sample of 495 X-ray sources found to show extended X-ray emission in the first processing of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The sample covers the celestial region with declination delta>=0deg and Galactic latitude |bII|>=20deg and comprises sources with a count rate >=0.06 counts s-1 and a source extent likelihood of L>=7. In an optical follow-up identification program we find 378 (76%) of these sources to be clusters of galaxies.  It was necessary to reanalyze the sources in this sample with a new X-ray source characterization technique to provide more precise values for the X-ray flux and source extent than obtained from the standard processing. This new method, termed growth curve analysis (GCA), has the advantage over previous methods in its ability to be robust, to be easy to model and to integrate into simulations, to provide diagnostic plots for visual inspection, and to make extensive use of the X-ray data. The source parameters obtained assist the source identification and provide more precise X-ray fluxes. This reanalysis is based on data from the more recent second processing of the ROSAT Survey. We present a catalog of the cluster sources with the X-ray properties obtained as well as a list of the previously flagged extended sources that are found to have a noncluster counterpart. We discuss the process of source identification from the combination of optical and X-ray data.  To investigate the overall completeness of the cluster sample as a function of the X-ray flux limit, we extend the search for X-ray cluster sources to the data of the second processing of the ROSAT Survey for the northern sky region between 9h and 14h in right ascension. We include the search for X-ray emission of known clusters as well as a new investigation of extended X-ray sources. In the course of this search we find X-ray emission from 85 additional Abell clusters and 56 very probable cluster candidates among the newly found extended sources. A comparison of the X-ray cluster number counts of the NORAS sample with the ROSAT-ESO Flux-limited X-Ray (REFLEX) Cluster Survey results leads to an estimate of the completeness of the NORAS sample of ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) I extended clusters of about 50% at an X-ray flux of FX(0.1-2.4 keV)=3×10-12 ergs s-1 cm-2. The estimated completeness achieved by adding the supplementary sample in the study area amounts to about 82% in comparison to REFLEX. The low completeness introduces an uncertainty in the use of the sample for cosmological statistical studies that will be cured with the completion of the continuing Northern ROSAT All-Sky (NORAS) Cluster Survey project.  Results reported here are based on observations made with the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {The core of the relaxed cluster AWM 4 is characterized by a unique combination of properties which defy a popular scenario for AGN heating of cluster cores. A flat inner temperature profile is indicative of a past, major heating episode which completely erased the cool core, as testified by the high central cooling time (>~3 Gyr) and by the high central entropy level (~60 keV cm2). Yet the presence of a 1.4 GHz active central radio galaxy with extended radio lobes out to 100 kpc reveals recent feeding of the central massive black hole. A system like AWM 4 should have no radio emission at all if only feedback from the cooling hot gas regulates the AGN activity.},

@article{cavagnolo09,
	Abstract = {We present radial entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) for a collection of 239 clusters taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Data Archive. Entropy is of great interest because it controls ICM global properties and records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy is therefore a useful quantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and investigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM entropy profiles are well fitted by a model which is a power law at large radii and approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K 0 + K 100(r/100 kpc)alpha, where K 0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best-fitting power law found at larger radii. We also show that the K 0 distributions of both the full archival sample and the primary Highest X-Ray Flux Galaxy Cluster Sample of Reiprich (2001) are bimodal with a distinct gap between K 0 ≈ 30-50 keV cm2 and population peaks at K 0 ~ 15 keV cm2 and K 0 ~ 150 keV cm2. The effects of point-spread function smearing and angular resolution on best-fit K 0 values are investigated using mock Chandra observations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. We find that neither of these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening we measure at small radii. The influence of profile curvature and number of radial bins on best-fit K 0 is also considered, and we find no indication that K 0 is significantly impacted by either. For completeness, we include previously unpublished optical spectroscopy of Halpha and [N II] emission lines discussed in Cavagnolo et al. (2008a). All data and results associated with this work are publicly available via the project Web site.},

	Abstract = {We present the X-ray characteristics of a sample of 368 clusters of galaxies with redshifts less than 0.2 observed with the Einstein Imaging Proportional Counter. For each cluster, we measure the 0.5-4.5 keV counting rate and compute the 0.5-4.5 keV source luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity within fixed metric radii. We detect 85% of Abell clusters with z<0.1, demonstrating that the large majority of these optically selected clusters are not the results of chance superpositions. For 163 clusters, we measure their X-ray surface brightness profiles and determine their core radii. For ~230 clusters, we then use either our measured core radii and beta values, or mean values derived for this sample, to measure central gas densities and gas masses. We use estimated or measured cluster gas temperatures, along with the derived gas-density profiles, to estimate total cluster masses, under the assumptions that the gas is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium. We also present contour plots of the X-ray emission, which we use to classify the cluster morphology. We find the percentage of clusters with substructure in their X-ray images is about 40%, with no significant change in this percentage as a function of X-ray luminosity. This implies that a large fraction of all present epoch clusters are still undergoing subcluster mergers. Based on our analysis of surface brightness profiles, we find that most clusters have core radii in the range from 0.1 to 0.3 Mpc (for H0=50 km s-1 Mpc-1), with more massive ``single'' clusters having larger core radii. The beta values determined from the slope of the surface brightness profiles fall in the narrow range from 0.4 to 0.8, with beta values increasing with cluster gas temperatures. No change in the value of beta is found in the surface brightness profiles for individual clusters as a function of distance from the cluster center. We compare the beta values derived from the surface brightness profiles with the corresponding beta values calculated from the gas temperatures and cluster velocity dispersions. We argue that much of the discrepancy between the values of beta derived from these two methods results from overestimates of the cluster velocity dispersion due to cluster substructure. Finally, we compare the gas mass to the cluster virial mass and find, for an isothermal gas, that, within a fixed metric radius of 1 Mpc, the gas mass fraction increases as a function of X-ray luminosity from 10% to 20% of the total cluster mass.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a 24-ks XMM-Newton observation of the NGC 5171 group of galaxies. NGC 5171 is unusual in that it is an X-ray bright group (LX > 1042 erg s-1), with irregular contours which are not centred on a bright galaxy. The global spectrum is adequately described by a single-temperature APEC model with TX= 0.96 +/- 0.04 keV and Z= 0.13 +/- 0.02Zsolar, in good agreement with previous ROSAT data. We find that the X-ray contours are centred on a bright ridge of emission stretching from the brightest group galaxy to a nearby galaxy. Spectral mapping reveals this ridge to be both cool (TX~ 1.1 keV) and metallic (Z~ 0.4 Zsolar) in comparison to its surroundings, suggesting it is the result of a tidal interaction between the two galaxies. Optical data reveal the member galaxies to have a high velocity dispersion (sigmav= 494 +/- 99 km s-1) and a significantly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, suggesting that the group is in the process of merging. A region of hot gas with TX= 1.58 +/- 0.36 keV is found to the west of the bright central ridge, and we interpret this as shock-heating resulting from the merging. A further region of emission to the south-east of the bright central ridge, with TX= 1.14 +/- 0.13 keV, is probably associated with a background group, four times more distant.},

	Abstract = {We present a temperature map and a temperature profile of the central part (r < 20' or 1/4 virial radius) of the Coma cluster. We combined 5 overlapping pointings made with XMM/EPIC/MOS and extracted spectra in boxes of 3.5'x3.5'. The temperature distribution around the two central galaxies is remarkably homogeneous (r<10'), contrary to previous ASCA results, suggesting that the core is actually in a relaxed state. At larger distance from the cluster center we do see evidence for recent matter accretion. We confirm the cool area in the direction of NGC 4921, probably due to gas stripped from an infalling group. We find indications of a hot front in the South West, in the direction of NGC 4839, probably due to an adiabatic compression.

	Abstract = {A new X-ray-selected and X-ray flux-limited galaxy cluster sample is presented. Based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, the 63 brightest clusters with galactic latitude |bII|>=20$\,^{\circ}$ and flux fX(0.1-2.4keV)>=2×10-11ergss- 1cm-2 have been compiled. Gravitational masses have been determined utilizing intracluster gas density profiles, derived mainly from ROSAT PSPC pointed observations, and gas temperatures, as published mainly from ASCA observations, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. This sample and an extended sample of 106 galaxy clusters is used to establish the X-ray luminosity-gravitational mass relation. From the complete sample the galaxy cluster mass function is determined and used to constrain the mean cosmic matter density and the amplitude of mass fluctuations. Comparison to Press-Schechter type model mass functions in the framework of cold dark matter cosmological models and a Harrison-Zeldovich initial density fluctuation spectrum yields the constraints Omegam=0.12+0.06-0.04 and sigma8=0.96+0.15-0.12 (90% c.l.). Various possible systematic uncertainties are quantified. Adding all identified systematic uncertainties to the statistical uncertainty in a worst-case fashion results in an upper limit Omegam<0.31. For comparison to previous results a relation sigma8=0.43Omega-0.38m is derived. The mass function is integrated to show that the contribution of mass bound within virialized cluster regions to the total matter density is small; i.e., Omegacluster=0.012+0.003-0.004 for cluster masses larger than 6.4+0.7-0.6×1013h- 150Msolar.},

	Abstract = {We examine the effects of pre-processing across the Coma Supercluster, including 3505 galaxies over ˜500 deg2, by quantifying the degree to which star-forming (SF) activity is quenched as a function of environment. We characterize environment using the complementary techniques of Voronoi Tessellation, to measure the density field, and the Minimal Spanning Tree, to define continuous structures, and so we measure SF activity as a function of local density and the type of environment (cluster, group, filament, and void), and quantify the degree to which environment contributes to quenching of SF activity. Our sample covers over two orders of magnitude in stellar mass (108.5-1011 M&sun;), and consequently, we trace the effects of environment on SF activity for dwarf and massive galaxies, distinguishing so-called mass quenching from environment quenching. Environmentally driven quenching of SF activity, measured relative to the void galaxies, occurs to progressively greater degrees in filaments, groups, and clusters, and this trend holds for dwarf and massive galaxies alike. A similar trend is found using g - r colours, but with a more significant disparity between galaxy mass bins driven by increased internal dust extinction in massive galaxies. The SFR distributions of massive SF galaxies have no significant environmental dependence, but the distributions for dwarf SF galaxies are found to be statistically distinct in most environments. Pre-processing plays a significant role at low redshift, as environmentally driven galaxy evolution affects nearly half of the galaxies in the group environment, and a significant fraction of the galaxies in the more diffuse filaments. Our study underscores the need for sensitivity to dwarf galaxies to separate mass-driven from environmentally driven effects, and the use of unbiased tracers of SF activity.},

	Abstract = {We study the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation in a self-consistent manner from 0 < z < 2.5 with 22,816 star-forming galaxies selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey. We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54% for log (M sstarf) > 10 at 1 < z < 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7%). The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

	Abstract = {We constrain the slope of the star formation rate (SFR; log Psi) to stellar mass (log M sstarf) relation down to log (M sstarf/M ☉) = 8.4 (log (M sstarf/M ☉) = 9.2) at z = 0.5 (z = 2.5) with a mass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the CANDELS fields. For the first time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that it is steeper at low masses (log Psivproplog M sstarf) than at high masses (log Psivprop(0.3-0.6)log M sstarf). These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum imaging; beta-corrected UV SFRs; and Halpha SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M sstarf/M ☉) < 10 the specific SFR (Psi/M sstarf) is observed to be roughly self-similar with Psi/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)1.9, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with Psi/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)2.2-3.5 for log (M sstarf/M ☉) = 10.2-11.2. The fact that we find a steep slope of the star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will help reconcile theoretical galaxy formation models with the observations.},

@article{tacchella15,
	Abstract = {Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of star-formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short depletion times ("blue nuggets"), while the lower-SFR galaxies in the lower envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions and longer depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS. Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS ridge on timescales $\sim0.4~t_{\mathrm{Hubble}}$ ($\sim1$ Gyr at $z\sim3$). The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g., by mergers, counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas compaction, depletion and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow ($\pm0.3$ dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{vir}}>10^{11.5}~M_\odot$) and/or at low redshifts ($z<3$), where the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.},

@article{gavazzi15b,
	Abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that the star formation rate per unit stellar mass (sSFR) decreases with increasing mass in normal main-sequence star-forming galaxies. Many processes have been advocated as being responsible for this trend (also known as mass quenching), e.g., feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and the formation of classical bulges. In order to improve our insight into the mechanisms regulating the star formation in normal star-forming galaxies across cosmic epochs, we determine a refined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local Universe. To this end we use the Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey (Halpha3) of field galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) in the Coma and Local superclusters. By complementing this local determination with high-redshift measurements from the literature, we reconstruct the star formation history of main-sequence galaxies as a function of stellar mass from the present epoch up to z = 3. In agreement with previous studies, our analysis shows that quenching mechanisms occur above a threshold stellar mass Mknee that evolves with redshift as ∝ (1 + z)2. Moreover, visual morphological classification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharp increase in the fraction of visually classified strong bars with mass, hinting that strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the sSFR above Mknee. We test this hypothesis using a simple but physically motivated numerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quench star formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. We conclude that strong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the inner parts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely required to quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies. Intriguingly, when we extrapolate our model to higher redshifts, we successfully recover the observed redshift evolution for Mknee. Our study highlights how the formation of strong bars in massive galaxies is an important mechanism in regulating the redshift evolution of the sSFR for field main-sequence galaxies.

	Abstract = {We introduce a new galaxy image decomposition tool, GALPHAT (GALaxy PHotometric ATtributes), which is a front-end application of the Bayesian Inference Engine (BIE), a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo package, to provide full posterior probability distributions and reliable confidence intervals for all model parameters. The BIE relies on GALPHAT to compute the likelihood function. GALPHAT generates scale-free cumulative image tables for the desired model family with precise error control. Interpolation of this table yields accurate pixellated images with any centre, scale and inclination angle. GALPHAT then rotates the image by position angle using a Fourier shift theorem, yielding high-speed, accurate likelihood computation.  We benchmark this approach using an ensemble of simulated S{\'e}rsic model galaxies over a wide range of observational conditions: the signal-to-noise ratio S/N, the ratio of galaxy size to the point spread function (PSF) and the image size, and errors in the assumed PSF; and a range of structural parameters: the half-light radius re and the S{\'e}rsic index n. We characterize the strength of parameter covariance in the S{\'e}rsic model, which increases with S/N and n, and the results strongly motivate the need for the full posterior probability distribution in galaxy morphology analyses and later inferences.  The test results for simulated galaxies successfully demonstrate that, with a careful choice of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and fast model image generation, GALPHAT is a powerful analysis tool for reliably inferring morphological parameters from a large ensemble of galaxies over a wide range of different observational conditions.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We attempt to determine the dominant processes acting on star-forming disk galaxies as a result of the cluster environment by studying the normalised rates and radial distributions of star formation in galaxies within low-redshift clusters. 
Methods: We develop indicators of different processes based on the radial concentrations of R-band and Hα light within each of the galaxies studied. The tests are applied to galaxies in each of 3 environments - cluster, supercluster (outside the cluster virial radius) and field. We develop new diagnostic diagrams combining star-formation rate and spatial distribution information to differentiate between stripping of outer disk gas, general gas depletion, nuclear starbursts and galaxy-wide enhancement of star formation. 
Results: Hubble type classifications of cluster galaxies are found to correlate only weakly with their concentration indices, whereas this correlation is strong for non-cluster populations of disk galaxies. We identify a population of early-type disk galaxies in the cluster population with both enhanced and centrally-concentrated star formation compared to their field counterparts. The enhanced cluster galaxies frequently show evidence of disturbance. A small but non-negligible population of cluster galaxies with truncation of star formation in their outer disks is also found.

	Abstract = {We have undertaken a survey of Hα emission in a substantially complete sample of CGCG galaxies of types Sa and later within 1.5 Abell radii of the centres of eight low-redshift Abell clusters (Abell 262, 347, 400, 426, 569, 779, 1367 and 1656). Some 320 galaxies were surveyed, of which 116 were detected in emission (39 per cent of spirals, 75 per cent of peculiars). Here we present previously unpublished data for 243 galaxies in seven clusters. Detected emission is classified as `compact' or `diffuse'. From an analysis of the full survey sample, we confirm our previous identification of compact and diffuse emission with circumnuclear starburst and disc emission respectively. The circumnuclear emission is associated either with the presence of a bar, or with a disturbed galaxy morphology indicative of ongoing tidal interactions (whether galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-group, or galaxy-cluster). The frequency of such tidally induced (circumnuclear) starburst emission in spirals increases from regions of lower to higher local galaxy surface density, and from clusters with lower to higher central galaxy space density. The percentages of spirals classed as disturbed and of galaxies classified as peculiar show a similar trend. These results suggest that tidal interactions for spirals are more frequent in regions of higher local density and for clusters with higher central galaxy density. The prevalence of such tidal interactions in clusters is expected from recent theoretical modelling of clusters with a non-static potential undergoing collapse and infall. Furthermore, in accord with this picture, we suggest that peculiar galaxies are predominantly ongoing mergers. We conclude that tidal interactions are likely to be the main mechanism for the transformation of spirals to S0s in clusters. This mechanism operates more efficiently in higher density environments, as is required by the morphological type-local surface density (T-Σ) relation for galaxies in clusters. For regions of comparable local density, the frequency of tidally induced starburst emission is greater in clusters with higher central galaxy density. This implies that, for a given local density, morphological transformation of disc galaxies proceeds more rapidly in clusters of higher central galaxy density. This effect is considered to be the result of subcluster merging, and could account for the previously considered anomalous absence of a significant T-Σ relation for irregular clusters at intermediate redshift.},

	Abstract = {In an objective prism survey of eight nearby Abell clusters, we have detected H-alpha emission from 77 out of a total of 201 CGCG spiral galaxies. We find that detection of H alpha emission is approximately independent of galaxy absolute magnitude, distance to the cluster center, and the presence of a bar. However, tidally distorted spirals are much more likely to be detected than undistorted spirals. Furthermore, there is a strong tendency for tidally distorted spirals to have compact nuclear emission rather than more extended disk-wide emission. When compared to field spirals, we find that late-type (Sc and Sc-Irr) cluster spirals have less H alpha emission, while early-type (Sa and Sab) cluster spirals can have significantly enhanced emission. The enhanced emission is most likely to be due to tidally induced star formation from galaxy-galaxy interactions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of galactic mass loss triggered by ram-pressure stripping of cluster galaxies on the evolution of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We use combined N-body and hydrodynamic simulations together with a phenomenological galaxy formation model and a prescription of the effect of ram-pressure stripping on the galaxies. We analyze the effect of galaxy - ICM interaction for different model clusters with different masses and different merger histories. Our simulations show that ram-pressure stripping can account for ~10% of the overall observed level of enrichment in the ICM within a radius of 1.3 Mpc. The efficiency of metal ejection of cluster galaxies depends in the first few Gyr of the simulation mainly on the cluster mass and is significantly increased during major merger events. Additionally we show that ram-pressure stripping is most efficient in the center of the galaxy cluster and the level of enrichment drops quite fast at larger radii. We present emission-weighted metallicity maps of the ICM which can be compared with X-ray observations. The resulting distribution of metals in the ICM shows a complex pattern with stripes and plumes of metal-rich material. The metallicity maps can be used to trace the present and past interactions between the ICM and cluster galaxies.},

@article{tonnesen12,
	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of star formation and feedback on ram pressure stripping using high-resolution adaptive mesh simulations, building on a previous series of papers that systematically investigated stripping using a realistic model for the interstellar medium, but without star formation. We find that star formation does not significantly affect the rate at which stripping occurs, and only has a slight impact on the density and temperature distribution of the stripped gas, indicating that our previous (gas-only) results are unaffected. For our chosen (moderate) ram pressure strength, stripping acts to truncate star formation in the disc over a few hundred million years, and does not lead to a burst of star formation. Star formation in the bulge is slightly enhanced, but the resulting change in the bulge-to-disc ratio is insignificant. We find that stars do form in the tail, primarily from gas that is ablated from the disc and the cools and condenses in the turbulent wake. The star formation rate in the tail is low, and any contribution to the intracluster light is likely to be very small. We argue that star formation in the tail depends primarily on the pressure in the intracluster medium, rather than the ram pressure strength. Finally, we compare to observations of star formation in stripped tails, finding that many of the discrepancies between our simulation and observed wakes can be accounted for by different intracluster medium pressures.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that the high pressure of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) can trigger the collapse of molecular clouds in a spiral galaxy, leading to a burst of star formation in the clouds. Our hydrodynamical simulations show that the high gaseous (ram pressure and static thermal) pressure of the ICM strongly compresses a self-gravitating gas cloud within a short timescale (~107 yr), dramatically increasing the central gas density and consequently causing efficient star formation within the cloud. The stars developed in the cloud form a compact, gravitationally bound star cluster. The star formation efficiency within such a cloud is found to depend on the temperature and the density of the ICM and the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to it. Based on these results, we discuss the origin of starburst/post-starburst populations observed in distant clusters, the enhancement of star formation for galaxies in merging clusters, and the isolated compact H II regions recently discovered in the Virgo Cluster.},

We find that at a given rB the majority of our cluster galaxies have rem smaller than those in the field, by 25 per cent on average. These results are compared with studies of local galaxies, which find a very similar behaviour. From the relations of rem and rB versus B-band absolute magnitude (MB) we infer that the difference between the intermediate-z cluster and field samples is mostly attributable to variation in rem at a given MB, while the rB versus MB relation is similar for the two samples.},

	Abstract = {The CAIRNS (Cluster and Infall Region Nearby Survey) project is a spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surrounding eight nearby, rich, X-ray-luminous clusters of galaxies. We have collected 15,654 redshifts (3471 new or remeasured) within ~5-10 h-1 Mpc of the centers of the clusters, making it the largest study of the infall regions of clusters. We determine cluster membership and the mass profiles of the clusters based on the phase-space distribution of the galaxies. All of the clusters display decreasing velocity dispersion profiles. The mass profiles are fitted well by functional forms based on numerical simulations but exclude an isothermal sphere. Specifically, NFW and Hernquist models provide good descriptions of cluster mass profiles to their turnaround radii. Our sample shows that the predicted infall pattern is ubiquitous in rich, X-ray-luminous clusters over a large mass range. The caustic mass estimates are in excellent agreement with independent X-ray estimates at small radii and with virial estimates at intermediate radii. The mean ratio of the caustic mass to the X-ray mass is 1.03+/-0.11, and the mean ratio of the caustic mass to the virial mass (when corrected for the surface pressure term) is 0.93+/-0.07. We further demonstrate that the caustic technique provides reasonable mass estimates even in merging clusters.},

	Abstract = {Physical processes regulating star formation in satellite galaxies represent an area of ongoing research, but the projected nature of observed coordinates makes separating different populations of satellites (with different processes at work) difficult. The orbital history of a satellite galaxy leads to its present-day phase space coordinates; we can also work backwards and use these coordinates to statistically infer information about the orbital history. We use merger trees from the MultiDark Run 1 N-body simulation to compile a catalogue of the orbits of satellite haloes in cluster environments. We parametrize the orbital history by the time since crossing within 2.5 rvir of the cluster centre and use our catalogue to estimate the probability density over a range of this parameter given a set of present-day projected (i.e. observable) phase space coordinates. We show that different populations of satellite haloes, e.g. infalling, backsplash and virialized, occupy distinct regions of phase space and semidistinct regions of projected phase space. This will allow us to probabilistically determine the time since infall of a large sample of observed satellite galaxies, and ultimately to study the effect of orbital history on star formation history (the topic of a future paper). We test the accuracy of our method and find that we can reliably recover this time within $\pm$2.58 Gyr in 68 per cent of cases by using all available phase space coordinate information, compared to $\pm$2.64 Gyr using only position coordinates and $\pm$3.10 Gyr guessing `blindly', i.e. using no coordinate information, but with knowledge of the overall distribution of infall times. In some regions of phase space, the accuracy of the infall time estimate improves to $\pm$1.85 Gyr. Although we focus on time since infall, our method is easily generalizable to other orbital parameters (e.g. pericentric distance and time).},

	Abstract = {We present three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of ram pressure stripping of massive disc galaxies in clusters. Studies of galaxies that move face-on have predicted that in such a geometry the galaxy can lose a substantial amount of its interstellar medium. But only a small fraction of galaxies is moving face-on. In this work we focus on a systematic study of the effect of the inclination angle between the direction of motion and the galaxy's rotation axis.  In agreement with some previous works, we find that the inclination angle does not play a major role for the mass loss as long as the galaxy is not moving close to edge-on (inclination angle <~60$\,^{\circ}$). We explain this behaviour by extending Gunn & Gott's estimate of the stripping radius, which is valid for face-on geometries, to moderate inclinations.  The inclination plays a role as long as the ram pressure is comparable to pressures in the galactic plane, which can span two orders of magnitude. For very strong ram pressures, the disc will be stripped completely, and for very weak ram pressures, mass loss is negligible independent of inclination. We show that in non-edge-on geometries the stripping proceeds remarkably similar. A major difference between different inclinations is the degree of asymmetry introduced in the remaining gas disc.  We demonstrate that the tail of gas stripped from the galaxy does not necessarily point in a direction opposite to the galaxy's direction of motion. Therefore, the observation of a galaxy's gas tail may be misleading about the galaxy's direction of motion.},

	Abstract = {We present an infrared study of a z = 0.872 cluster, SpARCS J161314+564930, with the primary aim of distinguishing the dynamical histories of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming members to assess the role of cluster environment. We utilize deep MIPS imaging and a mass-limited sample of 85 spectroscopic members to identify 16 24 mum bright sources within the cluster, and measure their 24 mum star formation rates (SFRs) down to ~6 M &sun; yr-1. Based on their line-of-sight velocities and stellar ages, MIPS cluster members appear to be an infalling population that was recently accreted from the field with minimal environmental dependency on their star formation. However, we identify a double-sequenced distribution of star-forming galaxies among the members, with one branch exhibiting declining specific SFRs with mass. The members along this sub-main sequence contain spectral features suggestive of passive galaxies. Using caustic diagrams, we kinematically identify these galaxies as a virialized and/or backsplash population. Moreover, we find a mix of dynamical histories at all projected radii, indicating that standard definitions of environment (i.e., radius and density) are contaminated with recently accreted interlopers, which could contribute to a lack of environmental trends for star-forming galaxies. A cleaner narrative of their dynamical past begins to unfold when using a proxy for accretion histories through profiles of constant (r/r 200) × (Deltav/sigma v ); galaxies accreted at earlier times possess lower values of (r/r 200) × (Deltav/sigma v ) with minimal contamination from the distinct infalling population. Therefore, adopting a time-averaged definition for density (as traced by accretion histories) rather than an instantaneous density yields a depressed specific SFR within the dynamical cluster core.},

@article{mahajan11,
	Abstract = {Ongoing or recent star formation in galaxies is known to increase with increasing projected distance from the centre of a cluster out to several times its virial radius (Rv). Using a complete sample (Mr<=-20.5, 0.02 <=z<= 0.15) of galaxies in and around 268 clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Fourth Data Release, we investigate how, at a given projected radius from the cluster centre, the stellar mass and star formation properties of a galaxy depend on its absolute line-of-sight velocity in the cluster rest frame, |vLOS|. We find that for projected radii R < 0.5 Rv, the fraction of high-mass non-brightest cluster galaxies increases towards the centre for low |vLOS|, which may be the consequence of the faster orbital decay of massive galaxies by dynamical friction. At a given projected radius, the fraction of Galaxies with Ongoing or Recent (<1-3 Gyr) Efficient Star Formation [GORES; with EW(Hdelta) > 2 {\AA} & Dn4000 > 1.5] is slightly but significantly lower for low |vLOS| galaxies than for their high-velocity counterparts. We study these observational trends with the help of a dark matter (DM) cosmological simulation. We classify DM particles as virial, infall and backsplash according to their present positions in (r, vr) radial phase space and measure the frequencies of each class in cells of (R, |vLOS|) projected phase space. As expected, the virial class dominates at projected radii R < Rv, while the infall particles dominate outside, especially at high |vLOS|. However, the backsplash particles account for at least one-third (half) of all particles at projected radii slightly greater than the virial radius and |vLOS| < sigmav (|vLOS| ≪sigmav). The deprojection of the GORES fraction leads to a saturated linear increase with radius. We fit simple models of the fraction of GORES as a function of class only or class and distance to the cluster centre (as in our deprojected fraction). While GORES account for 18 $\pm$ 1 per cent of all galaxies within the virial cylinder, in our best-fitting model, they account for 13 $\pm$ 1 per cent of galaxies within the virial sphere, 11 $\pm$ 1 per cent of the virial population, 34 $\pm$ 1 per cent of the distant (for projected radii R < 2 Rv) infall population and 19 $\pm$ 4 per cent of the backsplash galaxies. Also, 44 $\pm$ 2 per cent of the GORES within the virial cylinder are outside the virial sphere. These fractions are very robust to the precise good-fitting model and to our scheme for assigning simulation particle classes according to their positions in radial phase space (except for two of our models, where the fraction of GORES reaches 27 $\pm$ 4 per cent). Given the 1-3 Gyr lookback time of our GORES indicators, these results suggest that star formation in a galaxy is almost completely quenched in a single passage through the cluster.},

@article{jaffe11,
	Abstract = {With the aim of distinguishing between possible physical mechanisms acting on galaxies when they fall into clusters, we study the properties of the gas and the stars in a sample of 422 emission-line galaxies from the European Southern Observatory Distant Cluster Survey in different environments up to z˜ 1. We identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances (from emission lines in their 2D spectra) and find that they are more frequent in clusters than in the field. The fraction of kinematically disturbed galaxies increases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from the cluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. We also studied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from Hubble Space Telescope/F814W images, finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar in clusters, groups and the field. Moreover, there is little correlation between the presence of kinematically disturbed gas and morphological distortions. For the kinematically undisturbed galaxies, we find that the cluster and field Tully-Fisher relations are remarkably similar. In addition, we find that the kinematically disturbed galaxies show a suppressed specific star formation rate. There is also evidence indicating that the gas discs in cluster galaxies have been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentrated than in low-density environments. If spirals are the progenitors of cluster S0s, our findings imply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficiently disturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate. Moreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from the outskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both). In any case, this makes any remaining star formation more centrally concentrated, helping to build the bulges of S0s. These results, in addition to the finding that the transformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong morphological disturbances on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved are related to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playing only a limited role in clusters.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations to gain insights on how galaxies lose their cold gas at low redshift as they migrate from the field to the high density regions of clusters of galaxies. We find that beyond three cluster virial radii, the fraction of gas-rich galaxies is constant, representing the field. Within three cluster-centric radii, the fraction of gas-rich galaxies declines steadily with decreasing radius, reaching $\mathbf{<10%}$ near the cluster center. Our results suggest that galaxies start to feel the impact of the cluster environment on their gas content well beyond the cluster virial radius. We show that almost all gas-rich galaxies at the cluster virial radius are falling in for the first time at nearly radial orbits. Furthermore, we find that almost no galaxy moving outward at the cluster virial radius is gas-rich (with gas to baryon ratio greater than $\mathbf{1%}$). These results suggest that galaxies that fall into clusters lose their cold gas within a single radial round-trip.},

	Abstract = {In the local Universe, galaxies in groups and clusters contain less gas and are less likely to be forming stars than their field counterparts. This effect is not limited to the central group/cluster regions, but is shown by recent observations to persist out to several virial radii. To gain insight into the extent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxies around simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log 10Mhost/M&sun; = [13.0, 15.2]). In qualitative agreement with the observations, we find a systematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star-forming fraction of galaxies as far out as ˜5r200 from the host centre. A substantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and are not infalling for the first time (˜50 per cent at 2r200, independent of host mass) or are affected by `pre-processing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxies around groups, increasing to ˜50 per cent near a massive cluster), even a combination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for the environmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content. Direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas `halo' surrounding groups and clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gas atmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ˜5r200. We show that this influence is highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to a factor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of ram-pressure from the intracluster medium on the stripping of H I gas in galaxies in a massive, relaxed, X-ray bright, galaxy cluster at z = 0.2 from the Blind Ultra Deep H I Environmental Survey (BUDHIES). We use cosmological simulations, and velocity versus position phase-space diagrams to infer the orbital histories of the cluster galaxies. In particular, we embed a simple analytical description of ram-pressure stripping in the simulations to identify the regions in phase-space where galaxies are more likely to have been sufficiently stripped of their H I gas to fall below the detection limit of our survey. We find a striking agreement between the model predictions and the observed location of H I-detected and non-detected blue (late-type) galaxies in phase-space, strongly implying that ram-pressure plays a key role in the gas removal from galaxies, and that this can happen during their first infall into the cluster. However, we also find a significant number of gas-poor, red (early-type) galaxies in the infall region of the cluster that cannot easily be explained with our model of ram-pressure stripping alone. We discuss different possible additional mechanisms that could be at play, including the pre-processing of galaxies in their previous environment. Our results are strengthened by the distribution of galaxy colours (optical and UV) in phase-space, that suggests that after a (gas-rich) field galaxy falls into the cluster, it will lose its gas via ram-pressure stripping, and as it settles into the cluster, its star formation will decay until it is completely quenched. Finally, this work demonstrates the utility of phase-space diagrams to analyse the physical processes driving the evolution of cluster galaxies, in particular H I gas stripping.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between galaxy morphology and local density is derived from two complete galaxy redshift surveys. This relationship is completely consistent with the one derived by Dressler for a sample of 55 rich clusters. The apparently universal morphology-density relation extends over six orders of magnitude in galaxy space density. There is no dependence of galaxy morphology on density in regions where the dynamical time scale is comparable with or greater than the Hubble time. At densities greater than about 600 galaxies/cu Mpc, S0's dominate the galaxy population. At these densities, stripping mechanisms are likely to affect the galaxy population. At densities greater than about 3000 galaxies/cu Mpc, the fraction of elliptical galaxies rises steeply. In these regions, the collapse time is short compared with typical time scales for the formation of disks.},

@article{dressler80,
	Abstract = {The paper presents a study of the galaxy populations in 55 rich clusters along with a discussion of the implications for the formation and/or evolution of different morphological types. A well defined relationship is found between local galaxy density and galaxy type, which indicates an increasing elliptical and S0 population and a corresponding decrease in spirals with increasing density. Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.},

	Abstract = {We study the IR properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03 at z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 mum data with spectra of more than 400 galaxies and a very deep K-band-selected catalog. Nineteen IR cluster members are selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma Cluster. The best-fitting Schechter function gives L*IR=11.49+0.30-0.29 Lsolar with a fixed faint-end slope, about 1 order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the general decline of the cosmic SFR in different environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R200 in MS 1054-03 also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A nonnegligible fraction (13%+/-3%) of cluster members are forming stars actively, and the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star-forming galaxies from the surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward; instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.},

	Abstract = {Fitting a data set with a parametrized model can be seen geometrically as finding the global minimum of the chi2 hypersurface, depending on a set of parameters {Pi}. This is usually done using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The main drawback of this algorithm is that despite its fast convergence, it can get stuck if the parameters are not initialized close to the final solution. We propose a modification of the Metropolis algorithm introducing a parameter step tuning that optimizes the sampling of parameter space. The ability of the parameter tuning algorithm together with simulated annealing to find the global chi2 hypersurface minimum, jumping across chi2{Pi} barriers when necessary, is demonstrated with synthetic functions and with real data.},

	Abstract = {The Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-335) is a unique object, showing both type I and type II X-ray bursts. A type I burst of the Rapid Burster was observed with Swift/X-Ray Telescope on 2009 March 5, showing photospheric radius expansion (PRE) for the first time in this source. We report here on the mass and radius determination from this PRE burst using a Bayesian approach. After marginalization over the likely distance of the system (5.8-10 kpc), we obtain M = 1.1 $\pm$ 0.3 M &sun; and R = 9.6 $\pm$ 1.5 km (1sigma uncertainties) for the compact object, ruling out the stiffest equations of state for the neutron star. We study the sensitivity of the results to the distance, the color correction factor, and the hydrogen mass fraction in the envelope. We find that only the distance plays a crucial role.},

	Abstract = {We identify galaxy groups and clusters in volume-limited samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. We optimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems that occupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created by populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for galaxy groups with 10 or more members: a group multiplicity function that is unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated halos; a spurious group fraction of less than ~1% a halo completeness of more than ~97% the correct projected size distribution as a function of multiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is ~20% too low at all multiplicities. These results hold over a range of mock catalogs that use different input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. We apply our group-finding algorithm to the SDSS data and obtain three group and cluster catalogs for three volume-limited samples that cover 3495.1 deg2 on the sky, go out to redshifts of 0.1, 0.068, and 0.045, and contain 57,138, 37,820, and 18,895 galaxies, respectively. We correct for incompleteness caused by fiber collisions and survey edges and obtain measurements of the group multiplicity function, with errors calculated from realistic mock catalogs. These multiplicity function measurements provide a key constraint on the relation between galaxy populations and dark matter halos.},

	Abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8-28 mum range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the "Atlas Image" coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in "matched-filtered" images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W3- and W4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me.},

	Abstract = {We explore correlations between extinction-corrected Halpha, Hbeta and {[O II]_{double}} luminosities versus 12- and 22-mum band luminosities, based on matching samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). All the coefficients show strong correlations between Balmer lines and mid-infrared (MIR) luminosities, while the extinction-corrected {[O II]_{double}} shows a weaker correlation with MIR luminosities. The extinction-corrected emission-line (EL) luminosities are more tightly correlated with linear combinations of EL(obs) and MIR luminosities than with pure MIR luminosities. Linear combinations include both direct and dust-obscured star formation activity in galaxies and offer an improved star formation rate (SFR) indicator for star-forming galaxies. The factor that causes log10LMIR/log10LHalpha to vary is the metallicity. We find that log10(LHalpha(obs) + alpha × LMIR) and {log _{10}(L[O II]_double(obs)+alpha × L_MIR)}, rather than pure MIR luminosities or {[O II]_{double}} alone, are good proxies for extinction-corrected log10LHalpha, with a residual that is independent of metallicity. The morphologies have weak correlations with log10LMIR/log10LEL ratios. E(B - V) can be estimated by log10[LMIR/LHalpha(obs)].},

	Abstract = {With the goal of investigating the degree to which the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm TIR}$) traces the star formation rate (SFR), we analyze the $L_{\rm TIR}$ from the dust in a sample of $\sim$ 6000 star-forming galaxies, based on the 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 $\mu$m data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and u, g, r, i, z band data from SDSS DR9. These star-forming galaxies are selected by matching the WISE All Sky Catalog with the star-forming galaxy catalog in SDSS DR9 provided by JHU/MPA\thanks{$http://www.sdss3.org/dr9/spectro/spectroaccess.php$}. The values of $L_{\rm TIR}$ and SFR are derived from the project Code Investigating Galaxy Emission (CIGALE). We study the relationship between the $L_{\rm TIR}$ and SFR. From this study, we derive reference SFR indicators for use in our analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the $L_{\rm TIR}$ are found, and calibrations of SFRs based on it are proposed. The calibration holds for galaxies with verified observations and agrees well with previous works. The dispersion in the relation between $L_{\rm TIR}$ and SFR could partly be explained by the galaxy's properties, such as the 4000 {\AA} break.},

	Abstract = {We study star formation rate (SFR) indicators for Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 22 mum-selected, star-forming galaxies at 0.01 < z < 0.3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using extinction-corrected Halpha luminosities and total infrared luminosities as reference SFR estimates, we calibrate WISE mid-infrared- (MIR-) related SFR indicators. Both the 12 and 22 mum monochromatic luminosities correlate well with the reference the SFR estimates, but tend to underestimate the SFRs of metal-poor galaxies (at lower than solar metallicity), consistent with previous studies. We mitigate this metallicity dependence by using a linear combination of observed Halpha and WISE MIR luminosities for our SFR estimates. This combination provides SFR measurements as robust as those applied to Spitzer data by Kennicutt et al. However, we find that the coefficient a in L Halpha(obs) + aL MIR increases with the SFR, and show that a nonlinear combination of observed Halpha and MIR luminosities gives the best SFR estimates with small scatters and with little dependence on physical parameters. Such a combination of Halpha and MIR luminosities for SFR estimates is first applied to the WISE data. Using WISE data, we provide several SFR recipes that are applicable to galaxies with 0.1 lsim SFR (M &sun; yr-1) lsim 100.},

	Abstract = {We examine the origin of clustercentric gradients in the star formation rates and colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model where clusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. The model assumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation rates decline on a timescale of a few gigayears, the typical gas consumption timescale of disk galaxies in the field. Such behavior might be expected if tides and ram pressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation in spirals over a Hubble time. Combining these timescales with mass accretion histories derived from N-body simulations of cluster formation in a LambdaCDM universe, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the color distribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppression of star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentric radius. The simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxies beyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body of the cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation in the outskirts of clusters (and as far out as 2 virial radii) is systematically suppressed relative to the field. The agreement with the data beyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that stripping happens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the main body of the cluster. We conclude that the star formation rates of cluster galaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion onto massive virialized systems and that the cessation of star formation may have taken place gradually over a few gigayears.},

	Abstract = {We study the morphological content of a large sample of high-redshift clusters to determine its dependence on cluster mass and redshift. Quantitative morphologies are based on PSF-convolved, 2D bulge+disk decompositions of cluster and field galaxies on deep Very Large Telescope FORS2 images of eighteen, optically-selected galaxy clusters at 0.45 < z < 0.80 observed as part of the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (``EDisCS''). Morphological content is characterized by the early-type galaxy fraction f_et, and early-type galaxies are objectively selected based on their bulge fraction and image smoothness. This quantitative selection is equivalent to selecting galaxies visually classified as E or S0. Changes in early-type fractions as a function of cluster velocity dispersion, redshift and star-formation activity are studied. A set of 158 clusters extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is analyzed exactly as the distant EDisCS sample to provide a robust local comparison. We also compare our results to a set of clusters from the Millennium Simulation. Our main results are: (1) the early-type fractions of the SDSS and EDisCS clusters exhibit no clear trend as a function of cluster velocity dispersion. (2) Mid-z EDisCS clusters around sigma = 500 km s-1 have f_et ~= 0.5 whereas high-z EDisCS clusters have f_et ~= 0.4. This represents a ~25% increase over a time interval of 2 Gyr. (3) There is a marked difference in the morphological content of EDisCS and SDSS clusters. None of the EDisCS clusters have early-type galaxy fractions greater than 0.6 whereas half of the SDSS clusters lie above this value. This difference is seen in clusters of all velocity dispersions. (4) There is a strong and clear correlation between morphology and star formation activity in SDSS and EDisCS clusters in the sense that decreasing fractions of [OII] emitters are tracked by increasing early-type fractions. This correlation holds independent of cluster velocity dispersion and redshift even though the fraction of [OII] emitters decreases from z ˜0.8 to z ˜ 0.06 in all environments. Our results pose an interesting challenge to structural transformation and star formation quenching processes that strongly depend on the global cluster environment (e.g., a dense ICM) and suggest that cluster membership may be of lesser importance than other variables in determining galaxy properties.  Based on observations obtained in visitor and service modes at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) as part of the Large Programme 166.A-0162 (the ESO Distant Cluster Survey). Also based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

	Abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

	Abstract = {Integrated star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (SFR/M*), derived from the spectroscopic data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 4 (DR4), are used to show that the star formation activity in galaxies (Mr <= -20.5) found on the outskirts (1-2r200) of some nearby clusters (0.02 <= z <= 0.15) is enhanced. By comparing the mean SFR of galaxies in a sample of clusters with at least one starburst galaxy (log SFR/M* >= -10 yr-1 and SFR >= 10 M&sun; yr-1) to a sample of clusters without such galaxies ('comparison' clusters), we find that despite the expected decline in the mean SFR of galaxies towards the cluster core, the SFR profile of the two samples is different. Compared to the clusters with at least one starburst galaxy on their outskirts, the galaxies in the 'comparison' clusters show a lower mean SFR at all radius (<=3r200) from the cluster centre. Such an increase in the SFR of galaxies is more likely to be seen in dynamically unrelaxed (sigmav ≳ 500 km s-1) clusters. It is also evident that these unrelaxed clusters are currently being assembled via galaxies falling in through straight filaments, resulting in high velocity dispersions. On the other hand, 'comparison' clusters are more likely to be fed by relatively low density filaments. We find that the starburst galaxies on the periphery of clusters are in an environment of higher local density than other cluster galaxies at similar radial distances from the cluster centre. We conclude that a relatively high galaxy density in the infalling regions of clusters promotes interactions amongst galaxies, leading to momentary bursts of star formation. Such interactions play a crucial role in exhausting the fuel for star formation in a galaxy, before it is expelled due to the environmental processes that are operational in the dense interiors of the cluster.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a rich component of dusty star-forming galaxies contaminating the red-sequence in the supercluster system comprising Abell 901a, 901b and A902 at redshift ~0.17. These galaxies do not fit into the colour-density relation, because their preferred habitat is different from that of regular red-sequence galaxies, which are typically dust-poor, old and passively evolving. The dusty red galaxies prefer the medium-density outskirts of clusters while being rare in both the low-density field and the high-density cluster cores. This new result is based on the information content in the medium-band photometry of the COMBO-17 survey. The photo-z accuracy of the ~800 brightest cluster galaxies is <0.01 and of the order of the velocity dispersion of the cluster. This enables us to select a rich and clean cluster sample, in which we can trace age-sensitive and dust-sensitive spectral features independently with the detailed medium-band SED data. We find the red colour of the dusty galaxies to be a result of dust extinction combined with relatively old stellar ages. We speculate that the dusty red galaxies could either be a product of minor mergers between established old red cluster galaxies with infalling blue field galaxies, or mark a period in the internal transformation of blue field galaxies into red cluster galaxies, which is triggered by the environmental influences experienced during cluster infall.},

	Abstract = {Groups of galaxies---collapsed objects with masses in the range 1013--1014 M&sun; ---house most of the universe's baryons in the form of a kT ~ 1 keV plasma. To study the dynamics of the galaxies, the structure of the hot gas, and the overall distribution of dark matter in these low mass systems, we undertake a systematic X-ray and optical search for groups within 0.01 < z < 0.04 over 1/4 of the sky. By constructing the only statistically complete, redshift-selected sample of X-ray emitting groups, we seek to examine the X-ray and optical scaling laws of groups, the orbital distribution of the galaxies, and the relationship between star formation in the group members and the properties of the X-ray emitting medium. The final catalog consists of 260 optically selected groups, of which 59 have X-ray emission in the ROSAT All Sky Survey, as well as a redshift survey of 3000 galaxies in the direction of the X-ray emitting groups.},

	Abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ~105 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at http://www.galaxyzoo.org/Volunteers.aspx  E-mail: cjl@astro.ox.ac.uk (CJL); kevins@astro.ox.ac.uk (KS)},

	Abstract = {The Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) provides long-wavelength capability for the mission in imaging bands at 24, 70, and 160 mum and measurements of spectral energy distributions between 52 and 100 mum at a spectral resolution of about 7%. By using true detector arrays in each band, it provides both critical sampling of the Spitzer point-spread function and relatively large imaging fields of view, allowing for substantial advances in sensitivity, angular resolution, and efficiency of areal coverage compared with previous space far-infrared capabilities. The 24 mum array has excellent photometric properties, and measurements with rms relative errors of about 1% can be obtained. The two longer-wavelength arrays use detectors with poor photometric stability, but a system of onboard stimulators used for relative calibration, combined with a unique data pipeline, produce good photometry with rms relative errors of less than 10%.},

@article{chary01,
	Abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at lambda>5 mum and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at lambda>200 mum is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z>1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z~0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 mum CIRB is produced at 0<z<1.5, while only about 30% of the 850 mum background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25+0.12-0.1 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, and remains almost constant up to z~2. At least 70% of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with LIR>1011 Lsolar. The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z>2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z~3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z~4.},

@article{kauffmann04,
	Abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +/-500 km s-1 in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a factor of two towards higher masses between low- and high-density regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass galaxies (M* < 3 × 1010 Msolar, where M*= stellar mass) do we find a weak shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with stellar masses in the range 1010-3 × 1010 Msolar, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [OIII] emission in low-density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales: the lambda4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index HdeltaA, and the specific SFR/M*. The correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long (>1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3 × 1010 Msolar, the trends in recent SFH, dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift. We use mock catalogues derived from N-body simulations to explain how this may be understood.},

@article{balogh04,
	Abstract = {We analyse the observed correlation between galaxy environment and Halpha emission-line strength, using volume-limited samples and group catalogues of 24 968 galaxies at 0.05 < z < 0.095, drawn from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (MbJ< -19.5) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Mr < -20.6). We characterize the environment by: (1) Sigma5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projected distance to the fifth nearest neighbour; and (2) rho1.1 and rho5.5, three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxy distribution with Gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 and 5.5 Mpc, respectively. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form two distinct populations, as characterized by their Halpha equivalent width, W0(Halpha). The relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies vary strongly and continuously with local density. However, the distribution of W0(Halpha) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. The fraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density on large scales, rho5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with local density, rho1.1. We use two differently selected group catalogues to demonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximately independent of group velocity dispersion, for sigma= 200-1000 km s-1. Even in the lowest-density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies show significant Halpha emission. Based on these results, we conclude that the present-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a result of short-time-scale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift, such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.},

@article{mccarthy07,
	Abstract = {The thermal history of the intracluster medium (ICM) is complex. Heat input from cluster mergers, from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and from winds in galaxies offsets and may even prevent the cooling of the ICM. Consequently, the processes that set the temperature and density structure of the ICM play a key role in determining how galaxies form. In this paper, we focus on the heating of the ICM during cluster mergers, with the eventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models for galaxy formation.  We generate and examine a suite of non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations of mergers in which the initial temperature and density structure of the systems are set using realistic scaling laws. Our collisions cover a range of mass ratios and impact parameters, and consider both systems composed entirely of gas (these reduce the physical processes involved), and systems comprising a realistic mixture of gas and dark matter. We find that the heating of the ICM can be understood relatively simply by considering evolution of the gas entropy during the mergers. The increase in this quantity in our simulations closely corresponds to that predicted from scaling relations based on the increase in cluster mass.  We examine the physical processes that succeed in generating the entropy in order to understand why previous analytical approaches failed. We find the following. (i) The energy that is thermalized during the collision greatly exceeds the kinetic energy available when the systems first touch. The smaller system penetrates deep into the gravitational potential before it is disrupted. (ii) For systems with a large mass ratio, most of the energy is thermalized in the massive component. The heating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of the final system. This contrasts with spherically symmetric analytical models in which accreted material is simply added to the outer radius of the system. (iii) The bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinct episodes. The first episode occurs following the collision of the cores, when a large shock wave is generated that propagates outwards from the centre. This causes the combined system to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. The second entropy generation episode occurs as this material is shock heated as it recollapses. Both heating processes play an important role, contributing approximately equally to the final entropy. This revised model for entropy generation improves our physical understanding of cosmological gas simulations.},

Ram pressure and turbulent/viscous stripping remove 100% of the atomic hydrogen content of luminous galaxies like the Milky Way within 100 million years. These mechanisms naturally account for the morphology of S0 galaxies and the rapid truncation of star formation implied by spectroscopic observations, as well as a host of observational data on the neutral hydrogen (HI) morphology of galaxies in clusters.},

@article{chung07,
	Abstract = {In a new H I imaging survey of Virgo galaxies (VIVA: VLA Imaging of Virgo galaxies in Atomic gas), we find seven spiral galaxies with long H I tails. The morphology varies, but all the tails are extended well beyond the optical radii on one side. These galaxies are found in intermediate- to low-density regions (0.6-1 Mpc in projection from M87). The tails are all pointing roughly away from M87, suggesting that these tails may have been created by a global cluster mechanism. While the tidal effects of the cluster potential are too small, a rough estimate suggests that simple ram pressure stripping could have indeed formed the tails in all but two cases. At least three systems show H I truncation to within the stellar disk, providing evidence of a gas-gas interaction. Although most of these galaxies do not appear disturbed optically, some have close neighbors, suggesting that tidal interactions may have moved gas outward, making it more susceptible to the intracluster medium ram pressure or viscosity. Indeed, a simulation study of one of the tail galaxies, NGC 4654, suggests that the galaxy is most likely affected by the combined effect of a gravitational interaction and ram pressure stripping. We conclude that these one-sided H I tail galaxies have recently arrived in the cluster, falling in on highly radial orbits. It appears that galaxies begin to lose their gas already at intermediate distances from the cluster center through ram pressure or turbulent viscous stripping and tidal interactions with their neighbors, or a combination of both.},

Extensive simulations for a number of common situations realizable in small-to-large samples of cluster radial velocities allow the identification of minimum variance estimators. Also explored is the estimation of confidence intervals, using the jacknife and bootstrap resampling techniques. These methods are compared to simple formulas based on sample estimates of central location and scale. Estimators of confidence intervals on scale require resampling.},

	Abstract = {We describe a procedure for background subtracting Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging that improves the resulting detection and photometry of large galaxies on the sky. Within each SDSS drift scan run, we mask out detected sources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background. This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r 50 ~ 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data.},

	Abstract = {We perform two-dimensional, point-spread-function-convolved, bulge+disk decompositions in the g and r bandpasses on a sample of 1,123,718 galaxies from the Legacy area of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven. Four different decomposition procedures are investigated which make improvements to sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard SDSS procedures that lead to more robust structural parameters and integrated galaxy magnitudes and colors, especially in crowded environments. We use a set of science-based quality assurance metrics, namely, the disk luminosity-size relation, the galaxy color-magnitude diagram, and the galaxy central (fiber) colors to show the robustness of our structural parameters. The best procedure utilizes simultaneous, two-bandpass decompositions. Bulge and disk photometric errors remain below 0.1 mag down to bulge and disk magnitudes of g ~= 19 and r ~= 18.5. We also use and compare three different galaxy fitting models: a pure S{\'e}rsic model, an nb = 4 bulge + disk model, and a S{\'e}rsic (free nb ) bulge + disk model. The most appropriate model for a given galaxy is determined by the F-test probability. All three catalogs of measured structural parameters, rest-frame magnitudes, and colors are publicly released here. These catalogs should provide an extensive comparison set for a wide range of observational and theoretical studies of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Morphology is a powerful indicator of a galaxy's dynamical and merger history. It is strongly correlated with many physical parameters, including mass, star formation history and the distribution of mass. The Galaxy Zoo project collected simple morphological classifications of nearly 900 000 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, contributed by hundreds of thousands of volunteers. This large number of classifications allows us to exclude classifier error, and measure the influence of subtle biases inherent in morphological classification. This paper presents the data collected by the project, alongside measures of classification accuracy and bias. The data are now publicly available and full catalogues can be downloaded in electronic format from . This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at},

@article{schiminovich07,
	Abstract = {We use the UV-optical color magnitude diagram in combination with spectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the SDSS spectroscopic sample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z<0.25) and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and stellar mass (M*). Throughout this study our emphasis is on the properties of galaxies on and off of a local ``star-forming sequence.'' We discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different morphological types. We find, among other trends, that our measure of the star formation rate surface density, SigmaSFR, is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters, as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SFR/M* vs. M* space, while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SFR/M* at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SFR/M* and SigmaSFR above those on the ``star-forming sequence'' are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the ``red sequence.'' We find that this is a plausible scenario for bulge-dominated galaxies near the characteristic transition mass under reasonable assumptions regarding quenching timescales. Similarly, we use this technique to estimate the rate of mergers/starbursts that take galaxies off of the star-forming sequence and show that the implied merger rates are consistent with local measurements.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present spectroscopic observations of galaxies in 15 survey fields as part of the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS). We determine the redshifts and velocity dispersions of the galaxy clusters located in these fields, and we test for possible substructure in the clusters. Methods: We obtained multi-object mask spectroscopy using the FORS2 instrument at the VLT. We reduced the data with particular attention to the sky subtraction. We implemented the method of Kelson for performing sky subtraction prior to any rebinning/interpolation of the data. From the measured galaxy redshifts, we determine cluster velocity dispersions using the biweight estimator and test for possible substructure in the clusters using the Dressler-Shectman test.  Results: The method of subtracting the sky prior to any rebinning/interpolation of the data delivers photon-noise-limited results, whereas the traditional method of subtracting the sky after the data have been rebinned/interpolated results in substantially larger noise for spectra from tilted slits. Redshifts for individual galaxies are presented and redshifts and velocity dispersions are presented for 21 galaxy clusters. For the 9 clusters with at least 20 spectroscopically confirmed members, we present the statistical significance of the presence of substructure obtained from the Dressler-Shectman test, and substructure is detected in two of the clusters.  Conclusions: Together with data from our previous paper, spectroscopy and spectroscopic velocity dispersions are now available for 26 EDisCS clusters with redshifts in the range 0.40-0.96 and velocity dispersions in the range 166 km s-1-1080 km s-1.

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of galaxies in 4 clusters at z = 0.7-0.8 and in one cluster at z ˜ 0.5 obtained with the FORS2 spectrograph on the VLT as part of the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 20 intermediate to high redshift clusters. We describe our target selection, mask design, observation and data reduction procedures, using these first 5 clusters to demonstrate how our strategies maximise the number of cluster members for which we obtain spectroscopy. We present catalogues containing positions, I-band magnitudes and spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the fields of our 5 clusters. These contain 236 cluster members, with the number of members per cluster ranging from 30 to 67. Our spectroscopic success rate, i.e. the fraction of spectroscopic targets which are cluster members, averages 50% and ranges from 30% to 75%. We use a robust biweight estimator to measure cluster velocity dispersions from our spectroscopic redshift samples. We also make a first assessment of substructure within our clusters.  The velocity dispersions range from 400 to 1100 km s-1. Some of the redshift distributions are significantly non-Gaussian and we find evidence for significant substructure in two clusters, one at z ˜ 0.79 and the other at z ˜ 0.54.  Both have velocity dispersions exceeding 1000 km s-1 but are clearly not fully virialised; their velocity dispersions may thus be a poor indicator of their masses. The properties of these first 5 EDisCS clusters span a wide range in redshift, velocity dispersion, richness and substructure, but are representative of the sample as a whole. Spectroscopy for the full dataset will allow a comprehensive study of galaxy evolution as a function of cluster environment and redshift.

	Abstract = {We search for massive and compact galaxies (superdense galaxies, hereafter SDGs) at z = 0.03-0.11 in the Padova-Millennium Galaxy and Group Catalogue, a spectroscopically complete sample representative of the general field population of the local universe. We find that compact galaxies with radii and mass densities comparable to high-z massive and passive galaxies represent 4.4% of all galaxies with stellar masses above 3 × 1010 M &sun;, yielding a number density of 4.3 × 10-4 h 3 Mpc-3. Most of them are S0s (70%) or ellipticals (23%), are red, and have intermediate-to-old stellar populations, with a median luminosity-weighted age of 5.4 Gyr and a median mass-weighted age of 9.2 Gyr. Their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the small radii and high stellar mass estimates. Comparing with the WINGS sample of cluster galaxies at similar redshifts, the fraction of SDGs is three times smaller in the field than in clusters, and cluster SDGs are on average 4 Gyr older than field SDGs. We confirm the existence of a universal trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass. As a consequence, the median mass-size relation shifts toward smaller radii for galaxies with older stars, but the effect is much more pronounced in clusters than in the field. Our results show that, on top of the well-known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass, the luminosity-weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixed mass and, for a fixed mass and radius, on environment. This effect needs to be taken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizes from high to low z. Our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that a significant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high z have evolved into compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today. When stellar age and environmental effects are taken into account, the average amount of size evolution of individual galaxies between high and low z is mild, a factor ~1.6.},

	Abstract = {We analyse galaxies in 300 nearby groups and clusters identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using a photometric gas mass indicator that is useful for estimating the degree to which the interstellar medium of a cluster galaxy has been depleted. We study the radial dependence of inferred gas mass fractions for galaxies of different stellar masses and stellar surface densities. At fixed cluster-centric distance and at fixed stellar mass, lower density galaxies are more strongly depleted of their gas than higher density galaxies. An analysis of depletion trends in the two-dimensional plane of stellar mass M* and stellar mass surface density mu* reveals that gas depletion at fixed cluster-centric radius is much more sensitive to the density of a galaxy than to its mass. We suggest that low-density galaxies are more easily depleted of their gas, because they are more easily affected by ram-pressure and/or tidal forces. We also look at the dependence of our gas fraction/radius relations on the velocity dispersion of the cluster, finding no clear systematic trend.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of optically passive spirals and dusty red galaxies in the A901/2 cluster complex at redshift ~0.17 using rest-frame near-ultraviolet-optical spectral energy distributions, 24-mum infrared data and Hubble Space Telescope morphologies from the STAGES data set. The cluster sample is based on COMBO-17 redshifts with an rms precision of sigmacz ~ 2000kms-1. We find that `dusty red galaxies' and `optically passive spirals' in A901/2 are largely the same phenomenon, and that they form stars at a substantial rate, which is only four times lower than that in blue spirals at fixed mass. This star formation is more obscured than in blue galaxies and its optical signatures are weak. They appear predominantly in the stellar mass range of logM*/Msolar = [10, 11] where they constitute over half of the star-forming galaxies in the cluster; they are thus a vital ingredient for understanding the overall picture of star formation quenching in clusters. We find that the mean specific star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies in the cluster is clearly lower than in the field, in contrast to the specific SFR properties of blue galaxies alone, which appear similar in cluster and field. Such a rich red spiral population is best explained if quenching is a slow process and morphological transformation is delayed even more. At logM*/Msolar < 10, such galaxies are rare, suggesting that their quenching is fast and accompanied by morphological change. We note that edge-on spirals play a minor role; despite being dust reddened they form only a small fraction of spirals independent of environment.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a study of optical and H I properties of spiral galaxies (size, luminosity, Halpha flux distribution, circular velocity, and H I gas mass) to explore the role of gas stripping as a driver of morphological evolution in clusters. We find a strong correlation between the spiral and S0 fractions within clusters, and the spiral fraction scales tightly with cluster X-ray gas luminosity. We explore young star formation and identify spirals that are (1) asymmetric, with truncated Halpha emission and H I gas reservoirs on the leading edge of the disk, on a first pass through the dense intracluster medium in the cores of rich clusters; (2) strongly H I deficient and stripped, with star formation confined to the inner 5 h-1 kpc and 3 disk scale lengths; or (3) reddened, extremely H I deficient, and quenched, where star formation has been halted across the entire disk. We propose that these spirals are in successive stages of morphological transformation, between infalling field spirals and cluster S0's, and that the process that acts to remove the H I gas reservoir suppresses new star formation on a similarly fast timescale. These data suggest that gas stripping plays a significant role in morphological transformation and rapid truncation of star formation across the disk.},

	Abstract = {The transformations that take place in late-type galaxies in the environment of rich clusters of galaxies at z=0 are reviewed. From the handful of late-type galaxies that inhabit local clusters, whether they were formed in situ and survived as such, avoiding transformation or even destruction, or if they are newcomers that have recently fallen in from outside, we can learn an important lesson on the latest stages of galaxy evolution. We start by reviewing the observational scenario, covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the gas tracers (radio and optical) to the star formation tracers (UV and optical), the old star tracers (near-IR), and the dust (far-IR). Strong emphasis is given to the three nearby, well-studied clusters Virgo, A1367, and Coma, which are representative of different evolutionary stages, from unrelaxed and spiral-rich (Virgo) to relaxed and spiral-poor (Coma). We continue by providing a review of models of galaxy interactions that are relevant to clusters of galaxies. Prototypes of various mechanisms and processes are discussed, and their typical timescales are given in an appendix. Observations indicate the presence of healthy late-type galaxies falling into nearby clusters individually or as part of massive groups. More rare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups, where significant preprocessing might take place. Once they have entered the cluster, they lose their gas and quench their star formation activity, becoming anemic. Observations and theory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic medium is responsible for the gas depletion. However, this process cannot be the origin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population. Physical and statistical properties of S0 galaxies in nearby clusters and at higher redshift indicate that they originate from spiral galaxies that have been transformed by gravitational interactions.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the influence of ram-pressure stripping on the star formation and the mass distribution in simulated spiral galaxies. Special emphasis is put on the question of where the newly formed stars are located. The stripping radius from the simulation is compared to analytical estimates.  Methods: Disc galaxies are modelled in combined N-body/hydrodynamic simulations (GADGET-2) with prescriptions for cooling, star formation, stellar feedback, and galactic winds. These model galaxies move through a constant density and temperature gas, which has parameters comparable to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) in the outskirts of a galaxy cluster (T = 3 keV ≈ 3.6 × 107 K and rho = 10-28 g/cm^3). With this numerical setup we analyse the influence of ram-pressure stripping on the star formation rate of the model galaxy.  Results: We find that the star formation rate is significantly enhanced by the ram-pressure effect (up to a factor of 3). Stars form in the compressed central region of the galaxy, as well as in the stripped gas behind the galaxy. Newly formed stars can be found up to hundred kpc behind the disc, forming structures with sizes of roughly 1 kpc in diameter and with masses of up to 107 M&sun;. As they do not possess a dark matter halo due to their formation history, we name them ``stripped baryonic dwarf'' galaxies. We also find that the analytical estimate for the stripping radius from a Gunn & Gott (1972) criterion agrees well with the numerical value from the simulation. Like in former investigations, edge-on systems lose less gas than face-on systems, and the resulting spatial distribution of the gas and the newly formed stars is different.},

	Abstract = {We present the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) Survey, a systematic search for structure on scales greater than 10 h -1 70 Mpc around 20 well-known clusters at redshifts of 0.6 < z < 1.3. The goal of the survey is to examine a statistical sample of dynamically active clusters and large-scale structures in order to quantify galaxy properties over the full range of local and global environments. We describe the survey design, the cluster sample, and our extensive observational data covering at least 25' around each target cluster. We use adaptively smoothed red galaxy density maps from our wide-field optical imaging to identify candidate groups/clusters and intermediate-density large-scale filaments/walls in each cluster field. Because photometric techniques (such as photometric redshifts, statistical overdensities, and richness estimates) can be highly uncertain, the crucial component of this survey is the unprecedented amount of spectroscopic coverage. We are using the wide-field, multiobject spectroscopic capabilities of the Deep Multiobject Imaging Spectrograph to obtain 100-200+ confirmed cluster members in each field. Our survey has already discovered the Cl 1604 supercluster at z ≈ 0.9, a structure which contains at least eight groups and clusters and spans 13 Mpc × 100 Mpc. Here, we present the results on the large-scale environments of two additional clusters, Cl 0023+0423 at z = 0.84 and RX J1821.6+6827 at z = 0.82, which highlight the diversity of global properties at these redshifts. The optically selected Cl 0023+0423 is a four-way group-group merger with constituent groups having measured velocity dispersions between 206 and 479 km s-1. The galaxy population is dominated by blue, star-forming galaxies, with 80% of the confirmed members showing [O II] emission. The strength of the Hdelta line in a composite spectrum of 138 members indicates a substantial contribution from recent starbursts to the overall galaxy population. In contrast, the X-ray-selected RX J1821.6+6827 is a largely isolated, massive cluster with a measured velocity dispersion of 926 $\pm$ 77 km s-1. The cluster exhibits a well-defined red sequence with a large quiescent galaxy population. The results from these two targets, along with preliminary findings on other ORELSE clusters, suggest that optical selection may be more effective than X-ray surveys at detecting less-evolved, dynamically active systems at these redshifts.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the properties of the cluster of galaxies RX J1821.6+6827, or NEP 5281, at a redshift z= 0.816 $\pm$0.001. RX J1821.6+6827 was discovered during the optical identification of the X-ray sources in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) region of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and it is the highest redshift cluster of galaxies of the NEP  survey. We have measured spectroscopic redshifts for twenty cluster galaxies using the Keck-I and the Canada-France-Hawai'i (CFH) telescopes. The value for the cluster velocity dispersion is sigmaV=775+182-113 km s-1. The cluster was also observed by XMM-Newton. Both the optical and X-ray data are presented in this paper. The cluster has an unabsorbed X-ray flux in the 2-10 keV energy band of F2{-10 keV} = 1.24+0.16-0.23 ×10-13 erg cm-2 s-1 and a K-corrected luminosity in the same band of L2{-10 keV} = 6.32-0.73+0.76 ×1044 h-250 erg s-1 (90% confidence level). The cluster X-ray bolometric luminosity is LBOL,X = 1.35+0.08-0.21 ×1045 h50-2 erg s-1 (LBOL,X = 1.17+0.13-0.18 ×1045 h70-2 erg s-1 in the concordance cosmology). The data do not allow fitting both metal abundance and temperature at the same time. The abundance is unconstrained and can vary in the range 0.28-1.42 Z&sun; while the best fit X-ray temperature is T=4.7+1.2-0.7 keV. This emission weighted X-ray temperature is a little lower, barely within the uncertainties, than the predicted temperature, T= 6.34+0.13-0.35 keV, from the LX-TX relation of local clusters published in the literature. The optically measured velocity dispersion is consistent with the velocity dispersion expected from the &sigma/V-TX relationship. We also examine the point X-ray source RX J1821.9+6818, or NEP 5330, located to the south east of the cluster which was identified as a QSO at z= 1.692 $\pm$0.008 in the ROSAT NEP survey. The X-ray source is well fitted by an absorbed power law model with NH=4.1-3.0+3.1×1020 atoms cm-2 and a photon index Gamma=1.67$\pm$0.12 typical of an active galactic nucleus.  Data presented here used the XMM-Newton facility.},

We present follow-up ASCA, ROSAT High Resolution Imager, and Keck LRIS observations of the cluster RX J1716.6+6708, which was discovered during the optical identification of X-ray sources in the north ecliptic pole region of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. At z=0.809, RX J1716.6+6708 is the second most distant X-ray-selected cluster so far published and the only one with a large number of spectroscopically determined cluster member velocities. The optical morphology of RX J1716.6+6708 resembles an inverted S-shape filament with the X-rays coming from the midpoint of the filament. The X-ray contours have an elongated shape that roughly coincides with the weak lensing contours. The cluster has a low temperature, kT=5.66^+1.37_-0.58 keV, and a very high velocity dispersion sigma_los=1522^+215_-150 km s^-1. While the temperature is commensurate with its X-ray luminosity of (8.19+/-0.43)x10^44 h^-2_50 ergs s^-1 (2-10 keV rest frame), its velocity dispersion is much higher than expected from the sigma-T_X relationship of present-day clusters with comparable X-ray luminosity. RX J1716.6+6708 could be an example of a protocluster, where matter is flowing along filaments and the X-ray flux is maximum at the impact point of the colliding streams of matter.},

This cluster is only the third such X-ray emitting object known at redshifts greater than 0.8. X-ray emitting clusters at extreme distances are of special importance because they are massive, comparable to low-redshift examples, and their existence is problematic for some theories of structure formation. The luminosity of RX J1716.6+6708 is 3.2×1044 erg s-1 and the velocity dispersion of its member galaxies, based on 12 redshifts, is 1892 km s-1 The galaxies in RX 11716.6+6708 are spread along a filament perhaps indicating that it is more properly called a protocluster.},

	Abstract = {We present our discovery observations and analysis of RDCS 1317+2911, z=0.805, and RDCS 1350+6007, z=0.804, two clusters of galaxies identified through X-ray emission in the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey (RDCS). RDCS 1317+2911 has an unusual morphology in our Chandra observations, with an asymmetric surface brightness profile and a bend in the distribution of X-ray emission. In contrast, RDCS 1350+6007 appears to be more like low-redshift clusters, with beta=0.49+/-0.06 and rcore=165+/-5 kpc (Omegam=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.7, H0=65 km s-1 Mpc-1), though it also has an elliptical, slightly asymmetric surface brightness profile. We find a temperature of 3.7+1.5-0.9 keV and a bolometric luminosity of 8.2+1.7-1.6×1043 ergs s-1 for RDCS 1317+2911, and a temperature of 4.9+1.3-0.9 keV and a bolometric luminosity of 4.1+0.5-0.4×1044 ergs s-1 for RDCS 1350+6007. Our weak-lensing analysis of RDCS 1350+6007 confirms the general shape of the inner density profile but predicts twice the mass of the model based on the X-ray profile. There are two possibilities for this discrepancy: either there is a significant amount of mass near the redshift of the cluster that has not yet fallen into the potential well and shock-heated the gas, or, as we only see the X-ray emission from the core of the cluster, our beta model fails to describe the true shape of the underlying potential. We combine the X-ray luminosities and temperatures for RDCS clusters of galaxies with such measurements of other clusters at high redshift (z>0.7) and fit the luminosity-temperature relation. We find no statistically significant evolution in the slope or zero point of this relation at zmedian=0.83. This result is in agreement with models of intracluster medium evolution with significant preheating or high initial entropy values. Quantifying the bolometric luminosity-temperature relation as L=L6(1+z)A(T/6 keV)alpha, we find alpha=2.9+/-0.4, L6=8.7+/-0.9×1044 ergs s-1 and A=0.3+/-0.2, or A=0.4+/-0.2, depending on which low-redshift luminosity-temperature relation we compare with. With this result, we rule out at the 5 sigma level the self-similar scaling model of intracluster medium evolution. We discuss how low-temperature, high-redshift clusters of galaxies will allow us to improve on this result, and we announce the discovery of two such objects, CXOU J0910.1+5419 and CXOU J1316.9+2914.

	Abstract = {Spitzer-MIPS 24 mum observations and ground-based optical imaging and spectroscopy of the rich galaxy cluster Abell 851 at z = 0.41 are used to derive and compare star formation rates from the mid-IR 24 mum and from [O II] lambdalambda3727 emission. Many cluster galaxies have star formation rates SFR(24mum)/SFR([O II]) Gt 1, indicative of star formation in regions highly obscured by dust. We focus on the substantial minority of A851 cluster members where strong Balmer absorption points to a starburst on a 108-109 year timescale. As is typical, two types of galaxies with strong Balmer absorption are found in A851: with optical emission (starforming), and without optical emission (post-starburst). Our principal result is that the starforming variety, so-called e(a) galaxies, are mostly detected (9 out of 12) at 24 mum---for these we find typically SFR(24 mum)/SFR([O II]) ~4. Strong Balmer absorption and high values of SFR(24 mum)/SFR([O II]) indicate moderately active starbursts (SB); both observations support the picture that e(a) galaxies are the active starbursts that feed the post-starburst population. While 24 mum detections are frequent with Balmer-strong objects (even 6 out of 18 of the supposedly "post-starburst" galaxies are detected), only two out of seven of the continuously starforming `e(c)' galaxies (with weak Balmer absorption) are detected---for them, SFR(24 mum)/SFR([O II]) ~1. Their optical spectra resemble present-epoch spirals that dominate today's universe; we strengthen this association by showing that SFR(24 mum)/SFR([O II]) ~ 1 is the norm today. That is, not just the amount of star formation but also its mode has evolved strongly from z ~ 0.4 to the present. We fit spectrophotometric models in order to measure the strength and duration of the bursts and to quantify the evolutionary sequence from active to post-starburst. Our results harden the evidence that moderately active starbursts are the defining feature of starforming cluster galaxies at z ~ 0.4.},

	Abstract = {Using Spitzer-Multiband Imaging Photometer 24 mum imaging and extensive Keck spectroscopy, we examine the nature of the obscured star-forming population in three clusters and three groups at z ~ 0.9. These six systems are the primary components of the Cl1604 supercluster, the largest structure imaged by Spitzer at redshifts approaching unity. We find that the average density of 24 mum detected galaxies within the Cl1604 clusters is nearly twice that of the surrounding field and that this overdensity scales with the cluster's dynamical state. The 24 mum bright members often appear optically unremarkable and exhibit only moderate [O II] line emission due to severe obscuration. Their spatial distribution suggests that they are an infalling population, but an examination of their spectral properties, morphologies, and optical colors indicates that they are not simply analogs of the field population that have yet to be quenched. Using stacked composite spectra, we find that the 24 mum detected cluster and group galaxies exhibit elevated levels of Balmer absorption compared with galaxies undergoing normal, continuous star formation. A similar excess is not observed in field galaxies with equivalent infrared luminosities, indicating a greater fraction of the detected cluster and group members have experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past compared to their counterparts in the field. Our results suggest that gas-rich galaxies at high redshift experience a temporary increase in their star formation activity as they assemble into denser environments. Using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging, we find that disturbed morphologies are common among the 24 mum detected cluster and group members and become more prevalent in regions of higher galaxy density. We conclude that mergers are the dominant triggering mechanism responsible for the enhanced star formation found in the Cl1604 groups, while a mix of harassment and mergers are likely driving the activity of the cluster galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present spectroscopic observations of 182 disk galaxies (96 in the cluster and 86 in the field environment) in the region of the Abell 901/902 multiple cluster system, which is located at a redshift of z ~ 0.165. We estimate dynamical parameters of the four subclusters and analyse the kinematics of spiral galaxies, searching for indications of ram-pressure stripping. Furthermore, we focus on dusty red galaxies as a possible intermediate stage in the transformation of field galaxies to lenticulars when falling into the cluster.  Methods: We obtained multi-object slit spectroscopy using the VLT instrument VIMOS. We carried out a redshift analysis, determined velocity dispersions using biweight statistics, and detected possible substructures with the Dressler-Shectman test. We exploited rotation curves from emission lines to analyse distortions in the gaseous disk of a galaxy, as well as HST/ACS images to quantify the morphological distortions of the stellar disk.  Results: The presence of substructures and non-Gaussian redshift distributions indicate that the cluster system is dynamically young and not in a virialised state. We find evidence of two important galaxy populations. Morphologically distorted galaxies are probably subject to increased tidal interactions. They show pronounced rotation-curve asymmetries at intermediate cluster-centric radii and low rest-frame peculiar velocities. Morphologically undistorted galaxies show the strongest rotation-curve asymmetries at high rest-frame velocities and low cluster-centric radii. Supposedly, this group is strongly affected by ram-pressure stripping due to interaction with the intra-cluster medium. Among the morphologically undistorted galaxies, dusty red galaxies have particularly strong rotation-curve asymmetries, suggesting that ram pressure is an important factor in these galaxies. Furthermore, dusty red galaxies have on average a bulge-to-total ratio that is higher by a factor of two than cluster blue-cloud and field galaxies. The fraction of kinematically distorted galaxies is 75% higher in the cluster than in the field environment. This difference mainly stems from morphologically undistorted galaxies, indicating a cluster-specific interaction process that only affects the gas kinematics but not the stellar morphology. Also the ratio between gas and stellar scale length is reduced for cluster galaxies compared to the field sample. Both findings could be explained best by ram-pressure effects.  Conclusions: Ram-pressure stripping seems to be an important interaction process in the multiple cluster system A901/902. Dusty red galaxies might be a crucial element in understanding the transformation of field disk galaxies into cluster lenticular galaxies.

	Abstract = {We present optical, H I, and radio continuum observations of the highly inclined Virgo Cluster Sc galaxy NGC 4402, which show evidence for ram pressure stripping and dense cloud ablation. Very Large Array H I and radio continuum maps show a truncated gas disk and emission to the northwest of the main disk emission. In particular, the radio continuum emission is asymmetrically extended to the north and skewed to the west. The Halpha image shows numerous H II complexes along the southern edge of the gas disk, possibly indicating star formation triggered by the intracluster medium (ICM) pressure. Our BVR images at 0.5" resolution obtained with the WIYN Tip-Tilt Imager show a remarkable dust lane morphology: at half the optical radius, the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the disk, matching the H I morphology. Large dust plumes extend upward for ~1.5 kpc from luminous young star clusters at the southeast edge of the truncated gas disk. These star clusters are very blue, indicating very little dust reddening, which suggests dust blown away by an ICM wind at the leading edge of the interaction. To the south of the main ridge of interstellar material, where the galaxy is relatively clean of gas and dust, we have discovered 1 kpc long linear dust filaments with a position angle that matches the extraplanar radio continuum tail; we interpret this angle as the projected ICM wind direction. One of the observed dust filaments has an H II region at its head. We interpret these dust filaments as large, dense clouds that were initially left behind as the low-density interstellar medium was stripped but were then ablated by the ICM wind. These results provide striking new evidence on the fate of molecular clouds in stripped cluster galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The environmental dependencies of the characteristics of spiral galaxy rotation curves are studied in this work. We use our large, homogeneously collected sample of 510 cluster spiral galaxy rotation curves to test the claim that the shape of a galaxy's rotation curve strongly depends on its location within the cluster, and thus presumably on the strength of the local intracluster medium and on the frequency and strength of tidal interactions with the cluster and cluster galaxies. Our data do not corroborate such a scenario, consistent with the fact that Tully-Fisher residuals are independent of galaxy location within the cluster; while the average late-type spiral galaxy shows more rise in the outer parts of its rotation curve than does the typical early-type spiral galaxy, there is no apparent trend for either subset with cluster environment. We also investigate as a function of cluster environment rotation curve asymmetry and the radial distribution of H II region tracers within galactic disks. Mild trends with projected cluster-centric distance are observed: (i) the (normalized) radial extent of optical line emission averaged over all spiral galaxy types shows a 4+/-2% increase per Mpc of galaxy-cluster core separation, and (ii) rotation curve asymmetry falls by a factor of 2 between the inner and outer cluster for early-type spirals (a negligible decrease is found for late-type spirals). Such trends are consistent with spiral disk perturbations or even the stripping of the diffuse, outermost gaseous regions within the disks as galaxies pass through the dense cluster cores.},

@article{koopmann98,
	Abstract = {Quantitative measures of central light concentration and star formation activity are derived from R and H alpha surface photometry of 84 bright S0-Scd Virgo Cluster and isolated spiral galaxies. For isolated spirals, there is a good correlation between these two parameters and assigned Hubble types. In the Virgo Cluster, the correlation between central light concentration and star formation activity is significantly weaker. Virgo Cluster spirals have systematically reduced global star formation with respect to isolated spirals, with severe reduction in the outer disk, but normal or enhanced activity in the inner disk. Assigned Hubble types are thus inadequate to describe the range in morphologies of bright Virgo Cluster spirals. In particular, spirals with reduced global star formation activity are often assigned misleading early-type spiral classifications, irrespective of their central light concentrations; 45%+/-25% of the galaxies classified as Sa in the Virgo Cluster sample have central light concentrations more characteristic of isolated Sb-Sc galaxies. The misleading classification of low-concentration galaxies with low star formation rates as early-type spirals may account for part of the excess of "early-type" spiral galaxies in clusters. Thus, the morphology-density relationship is not all due to a systematic increase in the bulge-to-disk ratio with environmental density.},

	Abstract = {With the goal of investigating the degree to which the MIR emission traces the SFR, we analyze Spitzer 8 and 24 mum data of star-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with available HST NICMOS images in the Paalpha (1.8756 mum) emission line. The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 mum emission and the 24 mum emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Paalpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 mum emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 mum emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 mum emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 mum emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 mum emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 mum emission and the other using a combination of the 24 mum and Halpha luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 mum emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.  Based on observations obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by JPL, Caltech, under NASA contract 1407, and with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {The relation between spiral and S0 galaxies is considered in the light of recent data on the colors and morphology of disk systems and on the content of clusters at different redshifts. It is suggested that S0's may be disk systems that lost their gas-rich envelopes at an early stage and consumed their remaining gas by star formation. The fact that S0's have smaller disk-to-bulge ratios than spirals is consistent with this picture, as are the colors of S0's if most of their star formation stopped at least a few gigayears ago.},

	Abstract = {We measure the morphology-density relation (MDR) and morphology-radius relation (MRR) for galaxies in seven z~1 clusters that have been observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Simulations and independent comparisons of our visually derived morphologies indicate that ACS allows one to distinguish between E, S0, and spiral morphologies down to z850=24, corresponding to L/L*=0.21 and 0.30 at z=0.83 and 1.24, respectively. We adopt density and radius estimation methods that match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of the MDR and MRR. We detect a change in the MDR between 0.8<z<1.2 and that observed at z~0, consistent with recent work; specifically, the growth in the bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, fE+S0, with increasing density proceeds less rapidly at z~1 than it does at z~0. At z~1 and Sigma>=500 galaxies Mpc-2, we find <fE+S0>=0.72+/-0.10. At z~0, an E+S0 population fraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. The evolution in the MDR is confined to densities Sigma>~40 galaxies Mpc-2 and appears to be primarily due to a deficit of S0 galaxies and an excess of Sp+Irr galaxies relative to the local galaxy population. The fE-density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z=1 and 0. We find mild evidence to suggest that the MDR is dependent on the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the intracluster medium. Implications for the evolution of the disk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of these observations.},

	Abstract = {We present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect of environment on the star formation activity of galaxies within the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have used the Halpha emission line to derive the star formation rate (SFR) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0.05<=z<=0.095 and M(r*)<=-20.45. We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly correlated with the local (projected) galaxy density, and thus we present here a density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation. The effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the overall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments compared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for the strongly star-forming galaxies (Halpha EW>5 {\AA}) in the 75th percentile of the SFR distribution. Third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the density-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of ~1 h-275 Mpc-2. To understand this break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of clustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the SDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change, compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial radii (at the >1 sigma statistical significance), which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we observe in the density-SFR relation. This effect with clustercentric radius is again most noticeable for the most strongly star-forming galaxies. Our tests suggest that the density-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR relation we observe. For example, we have used the (inverse) concentration index of SDSS galaxies to classify late-type galaxies and show that the distribution of the star-forming (EW Halpha>5 {\AA}) late-type galaxies is different in dense regions (within 2 virial radii) compared with similar galaxies in the field. However, at present, we are unable to make definitive statements about the independence of the density-morphology and density-SFR relation. We have tested our work against potential systematic uncertainties including stellar absorption, reddening, SDSS survey strategy, SDSS analysis pipelines, and aperture bias. Our observations are in qualitative agreement with recent simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation that predict a decrease in the SFR of galaxies within the virial radius. Our results are in agreement with recent 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey results as well as consistent with previous observations of a decrease in the SFR of galaxies in the cores of distant clusters. Taken together, these works demonstrate that the decrease in SFR of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenon over a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10 h-275 Mpc -2) and redshift (out to z~=0.5).  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {Context: .Recent Hi and Halpha observations of NGC 4522 have revealed that this spiral galaxy represents one of the best cases of ongoing ram pressure stripping in the Virgo cluster. Aims: .We determined the parameters of the interaction between the interstellar medium of NGC 4522 and the intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Methods: .A dynamical model including ram pressure stripping is applied to the strongly Hi deficient Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4522. A carefully chosen model snapshot is compared with existing VLA Hi observations. Results: .The model successfully reproduces the large-scale gas distribution and the velocity field. However it fails to reproduce the large observed Hi linewidths in the extraplanar component, for which we give possible explanations. In a second step, we solve the induction equation on the velocity fields of the dynamical model and calculate the large scale magnetic field. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of relativistic electrons we obtain the distribution of polarized radio continuum emission which is also compared with our VLA observations at 6 cm. The observed maximum of the polarized radio continuum emission is successfully reproduced. Our model suggests that the ram pressure maximum occurred only ˜ 50 Myr ago. Conclusions: .Since NGC 4522 is located far away from the cluster center (˜ 1 Mpc) where the intracluster medium density is too low to cause the observed stripping if the intracluster medium is static and smooth, two scenarios are envisaged: (i) the galaxy moves very rapidly within the intracluster medium and is not even bound to the cluster; in this case the galaxy has just passed the region of highest intracluster medium density; (ii) the intracluster medium is not static but moving due to the infall of the M 49 group of galaxies. In this case the galaxy has just passed the region of highest intracluster medium velocity. This study shows the strength of combining high resolution Hi and polarized radio continuum emission with detailed numerical modeling of the evolution of the gas and the large-scale magnetic field.},

	Abstract = {We use a cosmological chemodynamical simulation to study how the group environment impacts the star formation (SF) properties of disk galaxies. The simulated group has a total mass of M ~ 8 × 10 12 Msolar and a total X-ray luminosity of LX ~ 1041 erg s-1. Our simulation suggests that ram pressure is not sufficient in this group to remove the cold disk gas from a Vrot ~ 150 km s-1 galaxy. However, the majority of the hot gas in the galaxy is stripped over a timescale of approximately 1 Gyr. Since the cooling of the hot-gas component provides a source for new cold gas, the stripping of the hot component effectively cuts off the supply of cold gas. This in turn leads to a quenching of SF. The galaxy maintains the disk component after the cold gas is consumed, which may lead to a galaxy similar to an S0. Our self-consistent simulation suggests that this strangulation mechanism works even in low-mass groups, providing an explanation for the lower SF rates in group galaxies relative to galaxies in the field.},

	Abstract = {The recently initiated Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey aims to map ~7000 deg2 of the high Galactic latitude sky visible from Arecibo, providing a H I line spectral database covering the redshift range between -1600 and 18,000 km s-1 with ~5 km s-1 resolution. Exploiting Arecibo's large collecting area and small beam size, ALFALFA is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the H I mass function in the local universe and will provide a census of H I in the surveyed sky area to faint flux limits, making it especially useful in synergy with wide-area surveys conducted at other wavelengths. ALFALFA will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the Local Supercluster and nearby superclusters, allow measurement of the H I diameter function, and enable a first wide-area blind search for local H I tidal features, H I absorbers at z<0.06, and OH megamasers in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.25. Although completion of the survey will require some 5 years, public access to the ALFALFA data and data products will be provided in a timely manner, thus allowing its application for studies beyond those targeted by the ALFALFA collaboration. ALFALFA adopts a two-pass, minimum intrusion, drift scan observing technique that samples the same region of sky at two separate epochs to aid in the discrimination of cosmic signals from noise and terrestrial interference. Survey simulations, which take into account large-scale structure in the mass distribution and incorporate experience with the ALFA system gained from tests conducted during its commissioning phase, suggest that ALFALFA will detect on the order of 20,000 extragalactic H I line sources out to z~0.06, including several hundred with H I masses MHI<107.5 Msolar.},

	Abstract = {We have measured the equivalent width of the Halpha emission line for 11006 galaxies brighter than Mb=-19 (OmegaLambda= 0.7, Omegam= 0.3, H0= 70 km s-1 Mpc-1) at 0.05 < z < 0.1 in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), in the fields of 17 known galaxy clusters. The limited redshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, and to residuals from night sky emission lines. We use these measurements to trace mu*, the star formation rate normalized to L*, as a function of distance from the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. We find that the distribution of mu* steadily skews toward larger values with increasing distance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution at distances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. A correlation between star formation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independent of cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1 galaxy Mpc-2 (brighter than Mb=-19). This characteristic scale corresponds approximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. The same correlation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the cluster centre. We conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are not restricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the density exceeds this critical value. The present-day abundance of such systems, and the strong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth of structure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average star formation rate. Finally, the low star formation rates well beyond the virialized cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressure stripping of disc gas, as being completely responsible for the variations in galaxy properties with environment.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic catalog of galaxies in 10 distant clusters from Dressler et al. We investigate the nature of the different spectral classes defined by Dressler et al., including star-forming, poststarburst, and passive galaxy populations, and reproduce their basic properties using our spectral synthesis model. We attempt to identify the evolutionary pathways between the various spectral classes in order to search for the progenitors of the numerous poststarburst galaxies. The comparison of the spectra of the distant galaxy populations with samples drawn from the local universe leads us to identify a significant population of dust-enshrouded starburst galaxies, showing both strong Balmer absorption and relatively modest [O II] emission, that we believe are the most likely progenitors of the poststarburst population. We present the differences between the field and cluster galaxies at z=0.4-0.5. We then compare the spectral and morphological properties of the distant cluster galaxies, exploring the connection between the quenching of star formation inferred from the spectra and the strong evolution of the S0 population discussed by Dressler et al. We conclude that either two different timescales and/or two different physical processes are responsible for the spectral and morphological transformation.},

	Abstract = {The rest-frame equivalent width of the [OII] lambda 3727 emission line, W0(O II), has been measured for cluster and field galaxies in the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology redshift survey of rich clusters at 0.2<z<0.55 . Emission lines of any strength in cluster galaxies at all distances from the cluster center, out to 2R200, are less common than in field galaxies. The mean W0(O II) in cluster galaxies more luminous than Mkr< -18.5 + 5 log h ( q0=0.1 ) is 3.8+/-0.3 A (where the uncertainty is the 1 sigma error in the mean), which is significantly less than the field galaxy mean of 11.2+/-0.3 A. For the innermost cluster members ( R<0.3R200 ), the mean W0(O II) is only 0.3+/-0.4 A. Thus, it appears that neither the infall process nor internal tides in the cluster induce detectable excess star formation in cluster galaxies relative to the field. The color-radius relation of the sample is unable to fully account for the lack of cluster galaxies with W0(O II) > 10 A, as expected in a model of cluster formation in which star formation is truncated on infall. Evidence of suppressed star formation relative to the field is present in the whole cluster sample, out to 2R200, so the mechanism responsible for the differential evolution must be acting at a large distance from the cluster center and not just in the core. The mean star formation rate in the cluster galaxies with the strongest emission corresponds to an increase in the total stellar mass of less than about 4% if the star formation is due to a secondary burst lasting 0.1 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We present a current catalog of 21 cm H I line sources extracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey over ~2800 deg2 of sky: the alpha.40 catalog. Covering 40% of the final survey area, the alpha.40 catalog contains 15,855 sources in the regions 07h30m < R.A. < 16h30m, +04$\,^{\circ}$ < decl. <+16$\,^{\circ}$, and +24$\,^{\circ}$ < decl. <+28$\,^{\circ}$ and 22h < R.A. < 03h, +14$\,^{\circ}$ < decl. <+16$\,^{\circ}$, and +24$\,^{\circ}$ < decl. < + 32$\,^{\circ}$. Of those, 15,041 are certainly extragalactic, yielding a source density of 5.3 galaxies per deg2, a factor of 29 improvement over the catalog extracted from the H I Parkes All-Sky Survey. In addition to the source centroid positions, H I line flux densities, recessional velocities, and line widths, the catalog includes the coordinates of the most probable optical counterpart of each H I line detection, and a separate compilation provides a cross-match to identifications given in the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Fewer than 2% of the extragalactic H I line sources cannot be identified with a feasible optical counterpart; some of those may be rare OH megamasers at 0.16 < z < 0.25. A detailed analysis is presented of the completeness, width-dependent sensitivity function and bias inherent of the alpha.40 catalog. The impact of survey selection, distance errors, current volume coverage, and local large-scale structure on the derivation of the H I mass function is assessed. While alpha.40 does not yet provide a completely representative sampling of cosmological volume, derivations of the H I mass function using future data releases from ALFALFA will further improve both statistical and systematic uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mapped the entire sky at mid-infrared wavelengths 3.4 mum, 4.6 mum, 12 mum, and 22 mum. The mission was primarily designed to extract point sources, leaving resolved and extended sources, for the most part, unexplored. Accordingly, we have begun a dedicated WISE Enhanced Resolution Galaxy Atlas (WERGA) project to fully characterize large, nearby galaxies and produce a legacy image atlas and source catalog. Here we demonstrate the first results of the WERGA project for a sample of 17 galaxies, chosen to be of large angular size, diverse morphology, and covering a range in color, stellar mass, and star formation. It includes many well-studied galaxies, such as M 51, M 81, M 87, M 83, M 101, and IC 342. Photometry and surface brightness decomposition is carried out after special super-resolution processing, achieving spatial resolutions similar to that of Spitzer Infrared Array Camera. The enhanced resolution method is summarized in the first paper of this two-part series. In this second work, we present WISE, Spitzer, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) photometric and characterization measurements for the sample galaxies, combining the measurements to study the global properties. We derive star formation rates using the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sensitive 12 mum (W3) fluxes, warm-dust sensitive 22 mum (W4) fluxes, and young massive-star sensitive ultraviolet (UV) fluxes. Stellar masses are estimated using the 3.4 mum (W1) and 4.6 mum (W2) measurements that trace the dominant stellar mass content. We highlight and showcase the detailed results of M 83, comparing the WISE/Spitzer results with the Australia Telescope Compact Array H I gas distribution and GALEX UV emission, tracing the evolution from gas to stars. In addition to the enhanced images, WISE's all-sky coverage provides a tremendous advantage over Spitzer for building a complete nearby galaxy catalog, tracing both stellar mass and star formation histories. We discuss the construction of a complete mid-infrared catalog of galaxies and its complementary role of studying the assembly and evolution of galaxies in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey, for star-forming field galaxies with M*>~1010 Msolar out to z=1.1. The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M*. With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged galaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e-folding times tau, and a later onset of SF (zf). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M* and z, and quantify mass dependences of tau and zf, from direct observations of M* and SFRs up to z>1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

	Abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 mum photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 sigma<~+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <~2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a CO line survey of 30 galaxies at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.2-0.6), with the IRAM 30 m telescope, with the goal to follow galaxy evolution and in particular the star formation efficiency (SFE) as defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass (LFIR/M(H2)). The sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infra-red galaxies (ULIRGs), with LFIR larger than 2.8 × 1012 L&sun;, experiencing starbursts; adopting a low ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their gas consumption time-scale is lower than 108 yr. To date only very few CO observations exist in this redshift range that spans nearly 25% of the universe's age. Considerable evolution of the star formation rate is already observed during this period. 18 galaxies out of our sample of 30 are detected (of which 16 are new detections), corresponding to a detection rate of 60%. The average CO luminosity for the 18 galaxies detected is L'CO = 2×10 10 K km s-1 pc2, corresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.6 × 1010 M&sun;. The FIR luminosity correlates well with the CO luminosity, in agreement with the correlation found for low and high redshift ULIRGs. Although the conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass is uncertain, we find that the maximum amount of gas available for a single galaxy is quickly increasing as a function of redshift. Using the same conversion factor, the SFEs for z ~ 0.2 - 0.6 ULIRGs are found to be significantly higher, by a factor 3, than for local ULIRGs, and are comparable to high redshift ones. We compare this evolution to the expected cosmic H2 abundance and the cosmic star formation history.  Based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain).},

	Abstract = {After new observations of 39 galaxies at z = 0.6-1.0 obtained at the IRAM 30m telescope, we present our full CO line survey covering the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1. Our aim is to determine the driving factors accounting for the steep decline in the star formation rate during this epoch. We study both the gas fraction, defined as Mgas/(Mgas+Mstar), and the star formation efficiency (SFE) defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass (LFIR/M(H2), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. The sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with LFIR greater than 10^12 Lo and experiencing starbursts. When we adopt a standard ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is less than 100 Myr. Our full survey has now filled the gap of CO observations in the 0.2<z<1 range covering almost half of cosmic history. The detection rate in the 0.6 < z < 1 interval is 38% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60% for the 0.2<z<0.6 interval. The average CO luminosity is L'CO = 1.8 10^10 K km/s pc^2, corresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.45 10^10 Mo. From observation of 7 galaxies in both CO(2-1) and CO(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived; together with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our low ULIRG conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2, for our sample sources. We find that both the gas fraction and the SFE significantly increase with redshift, by factors of 3 +-1 from z=0 to 1, and therefore both quantities play an important role and complement each other in cosmic star formation evolution.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a new method for fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to identify and constrain the physical properties of high-redshift (4 < z < 8) galaxies. Our approach uses an implementation of Bayesian based Markov Chain Monte Carlo that we have dubbed "piMC2." It allows us to compare observations to arbitrarily complex models and to compute 95% credible intervals that provide robust constraints for the model parameters. The work is presented in two sections. In the first, we test piMC2 using simulated SEDs to not only confirm the recovery of the known inputs but to assess the limitations of the method and identify potential hazards of SED fitting when applied specifically to high-redshift (z > 4) galaxies. In the second part of the paper we apply piMC2 to thirty-three 4 < z < 8 objects, including the spectroscopically confirmed Grism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science Lyalpha sample (4 < z < 6), supplemented by newly obtained Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 near-IR observations, and several recently reported broadband selected z > 6 galaxies. Using piMC2, we are able to constrain the stellar mass of these objects and in some cases their stellar age and find no evidence that any of these sources formed at a redshift larger than z = 8, a time when the universe was ≈0.6 Gyr old.},

	Abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

	Abstract = {We present the deepest 100 to 500 mum far-infrared observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the GOODS-Herschel key program, and examine the infrared (IR) 3-500 mum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at 0 < z < 2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, and AKARI data. We determine the projected star formation densities of local galaxies from their radio and mid-IR continuum sizes. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8 mum luminosity, IR8 (≡ LIRtot), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8 = 4 (sigma = 1.6) and defines an IR main sequence for star-forming galaxies independent of redshift and luminosity. Outliers from this main sequence produce a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8. This minority population (<20%) is shown to consist of starbursts with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact starbursts with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness (SigmaIR > 3 × 1010 L&sun; kpc-2) and a high specific star formation rate (i.e., starbursts). The rest-frame, UV-2700 {\AA} size of these distant starbursts is typically half that of main sequence galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and starburst activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies, (U)LIRGs (LIRtot), are systematically in the starburst mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the "normal" main sequence mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called "mid-IR excess" population of galaxies found at z > 1.5 by previous studies. Main sequence galaxies have strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust ~ 15-50 K), and an effective Tdust ~ 31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their infrared SED. Galaxies in the starburst regime instead exhibit weak PAH equivalent widths and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust ~ 40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR emission of X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN) is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty starbursts. After correcting for the effect of starbursts on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.

	Abstract = {Measurements of H alpha , H I, and CO distributions in 61 normal spiral galaxies are combined with published far-infrared and CO observations of 36 infrared-selected starburst galaxies, in order to study the form of the global star formation law over the full range of gas densities and star formation rates (SFRs) observed in galaxies. The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	Abstract = {This is the second paper of two reporting results from a study of the H I content and stellar properties of nearby galaxies detected by the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA blind 21 cm line survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a 2160 deg2 region of high galactic latitude sky covered by both surveys, in the general Virgo direction. Here, we analyze a complete H I flux-limited subset of 1624 objects with homogeneously measured 21 cm and multi-wavelength optical attributes extracted from the control sample of H I emitters in environments of low local galactic density assembled by Toribio et al. (Paper I). Strategies of multivariate data analysis are applied to this data set in order to (i) investigate the correlation structure of the space defined by an extensive set of potentially independent observables describing gas-rich systems, (ii) identify the intrinsic parameters that best define their neutral gas content, and (iii) explore the scaling relations arising from the joint distributions of the quantities most strongly correlated with the H I mass. The principal component analysis performed over a set of five galaxy properties reveals that they are strongly interrelated, supporting previous claims that nearby H I emitters show a high degree of correlation. The best predictors for the expected value of M H I  are the diameter of the stellar disk, D 25,r , followed by the total luminosity (both in the r band), and the maximum rotation speed, while morphological proxies such as color show only a moderately strong correlation with the gaseous content attenuated by observational error. Among the various inferred prescriptions, the simplest and most accurate is log(M H I /M sun) = 8.72 + 1.25 log(D 25,r /kpc). We find a slope of -8.2 $\pm$ 0.5 for the relation between optical magnitude and log rotation speed, in good agreement with Tully-Fisher studies, as well as a log slope of 1.55 $\pm$ 0.06 for the H I mass-optical galaxy size relation. Given the homogeneity of the measurements and the completeness of our data set, the latter outcome suggests that the constancy of the average (hybrid) H I surface density advocated by some authors for the spiral population is just a crude approximation.},

@article{stasinska06,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the techniques to distinguish normal star-forming (NSF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosts using optical spectra. The observational data base is a set of 20000 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for which we have determined the emission-line intensities after subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing radiation predicted by population synthesis codes (essentially STARBURST99) and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law spectrum. We explain why, among the four classical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, ([OIII]/Hbeta versus [OII]/Hbeta, [OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha (the BPT diagram), [OIII]/Hbeta versus [SII]/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta versus [OI]/Halpha), the BPT one works best. We show, however, that none of these diagrams is efficient in detecting AGNs in metal-poor galaxies, should such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between `pure' NSF galaxies and AGN hosts: y = (-30.787 + 1.1358x + 0.27297x2) tanh (5.7409x) - 31.093, where y = log([OIII]/Hbeta), and x = log([NII]/Halpha). According to our models, the divisory line drawn empirically by Kauffmann et al. includes among NSF galaxies objects that may have an AGN contribution to Hbeta of up to 3 per cent. The Kewley et al. line allows for an AGN contribution of roughly 20 per cent. About 20 per cent of the galaxies in our entire sample that can be represented in the BTP diagram are found between our divisory line and the Kauffmann et al. line, meaning that the local Universe contains a fair proportion of galaxies with a very low-level nuclear activity, in agreement with the statistics from observations of nuclei of nearby galaxies. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN galaxies using only [NII]/Halpha is feasible and useful.  Finally, we propose a new classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting Dn(4000) versus max(EW[OII], EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see all the galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We examine the properties of the host galaxies of 22 623 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with 0.02 < z < 0.3 selected from a complete sample of 122 808 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]lambda5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hdelta absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

Devising a simple numerical indicator of the central concentration of clusters, we find it to be strongly correlated with the spiral galaxy content of the clusters. Only the least-concentrated clusters show an appreciable content of spiral galaxies, in strong contrast to the distant clusters described in our previous paper. If we are observing nearby clusters at every stage of dynamical evolution, these results strongly support the hypothesis of an efficient stripping mechanism in collapsed clusters.},

	Abstract = {Using mid-IR and optical data, we deduce the total infrared (IR) luminosities of galaxies in the Coma Cluster and present their IR luminosity function (LF). The shape of the overall Coma IR LF does not show significant differences from the IR LFs of the general field, which indicates the general independence of global galaxy star formation from environment up to densities ~40 times greater than in the field (we cannot test such independence above LIR~1044 ergs s-1). However, a shallower faint-end slope and a smaller L*IR are found in the core region (where the densities are still higher) compared to the outskirt region of the cluster, and most of the brightest IR galaxies are found outside the core region. The IR LF in the NGC 4839 group region does not show any unique characteristics. By integrating the IR LF, we find a total star formation rate in the cluster of about 97.0 Msolar yr-1. We also studied the contributions of early- and late-type galaxies to the IR LF. The late-type galaxies dominate the bright end of the LF, and the early-type galaxies, although only making up a small portion (~15%) of the total IR emission of the cluster, contribute greatly to the number counts of the LF at LIR<1043 ergs s-1.},

	Abstract = {We present Multiband Imaging Photometer observations of the cluster A3266. About 100 spectroscopic cluster members have been detected at 24 mum. The infrared (IR) luminosity function (LF) in A3266 is very similar to that in the Coma cluster down to the detection limit L IR ~ 1043 erg s-1, suggesting a universal form of the bright-end IR LF for local rich clusters with M ~ 1015 M sun. The shape of the bright end of the A3266-Coma composite IR LF is not significantly different from that of nearby field galaxies, but the fraction of IR-bright galaxies (star formation rate (SFR) >0.2 M sun yr-1) in both clusters increases with cluster-centric radius. The decrease of the blue galaxy fraction toward the high-density cores only accounts for part of the trend; the fraction of red galaxies with moderate SFRs (0.2 M sun yr-1 < SFR < 1 M sun yr-1) also decreases with increasing galaxy density. These results suggest that for the IR-bright galaxies nearby rich clusters are distinguished from the field by a lower star forming galaxy fraction, but not by a change in L*IR. The composite IR LF of Coma and A3266 shows strong evolution when compared with the composite IR LF of two z ~ 0.8 clusters, MS 1054 and RX J0152, with L^{*}_IR∝ (1+z)^{3.2^{+0.7}_{-0.7}} and Phi ^{*}_IR∝ (1+z)^{1.7^{+1.0}_{-1.0}}. This L*IR evolution is indistinguishable from that in the field, and the Phi*IR evolution is stronger, but still consistent with that in the field. The similarity of the evolution of the bright-end IR LF in very different cluster and field environments suggests either this evolution is driven by the mechanism that works in both environments, or clusters continually replenish their star forming galaxies from the field, yielding an evolution in the IR LF that is similar to the field. The mass-normalized integrated SFRs of clusters within 0.5R 200 also evolve strongly with redshift as (1 + z)5.3.},

	Abstract = {We have used a combination of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models to develop a set of ionization parameter and abundance diagnostics based only on the use of the strong optical emission lines. These models are applicable to both extragalactic H II regions and star-forming galaxies. We show that, because our techniques solve explicitly for both the ionization parameter and the chemical abundance, the diagnostics presented here are an improvement on earlier techniques based on strong emission-line ratios. Our techniques are applicable at all metallicities. In particular, for metallicities above half solar, the ratio [N II]/[O II] provides a very reliable diagnostic since it is ionization parameter independent and does not have a local maximum. This ratio has not previously been used historically because of worries about reliable calibration over such a long baseline, and reddening correction concerns. However, we show that the use of classical reddening curves and standard calibration are quite sufficient to allow this [N II]/[O II] diagnostic to be used with confidence as a reliable abundance indicator. As we had shown, the commonly used abundance diagnostic R23 depends strongly on the ionization parameter, while the commonly used ionization parameter diagnostic [O III]/[O II] depends strongly on abundance. The iterative method of solution presented here allows both of these parameters to be obtained without recourse to the use of temperature-sensitive line ratios involving faint emission lines. We compare three commonly used abundance diagnostic techniques and show that individually, they contain systematic and random errors. This is a problem affecting many abundance diagnostics, and the errors generally have not been properly studied or understood due to the lack of a reliable comparison abundance, except for very low metallicities, where the [O III] lambda4363 auroral line is used. Here we show that the average of these techniques provides a fairly reliable comparison abundance indicator against which to test new diagnostic methods. The cause of the systematic effects are discussed, and we present a new ``optimal'' abundance diagnostic method based on the use of line ratios involving [N II], [O II], [O III], [S II], and the Balmer lines. This combined diagnostic appears to suffer no apparent systematic errors, can be used over the entire abundance range and significantly reduces the random error inherent in previous techniques. Finally, we give a recommended procedure for the derivation of abundances in the case that only spectra of limited wavelength coverage are available so that the optimal method can no longer be used.},

	Abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates, star formation histories, and the intracluster light as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates from z=0 to z=8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. We also provide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10^12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LCDM.},

	Abstract = {Using reconstructed galaxy star formation histories, we calculate the instantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formation rate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from z=8 to the present day. This efficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 10^11.7 Msun, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the mass scale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. Above the characteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minus four-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off at an average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. By comparison, the shape and normalization of the efficiency change very little since z=4. We show that a time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of the cosmic star formation rate since z=4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates. The rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z=2 is especially sensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. The mass dependence of the efficiency strongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result that two-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor of three of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We study the mid-infrared properties of 1315 spectroscopically confirmed members in eight massive (Mvir>~5×1014 Msolar) galaxy clusters covering the redshift range from 0.02 to 0.83. The selected clusters all have deep Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum observations, Hubble and ground-based photometry, and extensive redshift catalogs. We observe for the first time an increase in the fraction of cluster galaxies with mid-infrared star formation rates higher than 5 Msolar yr-1 from 3% at z=0.02 to 13% at z=0.83 (RP<=1 Mpc). This increase is reproduced even when considering only the most massive members (M*>=4×1010 Msolar). The 24 mum observations reveal stronger evolution in the fraction of blue/star-forming cluster galaxies than in color-selected samples: the number of dusty, strongly star-forming cluster galaxies increases with redshift, and combining these with the optically defined Butcher-Oemler members [Delta(B-V)<-0.2] doubles the total fraction of blue/star-forming galaxies in the inner Mpc of the clusters to ~23% at z=0.83. These results, the first of our Spitzer/MIPS Infra-Red Cluster Survey (SMIRCS), support earlier studies indicating that the increase in star-forming members is driven by cluster assembly and galaxy infall, as is expected in the framework of hierarchical formation.},

In each cluster, those galaxies brighter than M(v) = -20 which are within the circular area containing the inner 30 percent of the total cluster population are selected. From the distribution of these galaxies in the color-magnitude plane, the fraction of galaxies whose rest-frame B-V colors are at least 0.2 mag bluer than the ridge line of the early-type galaxies at that magnitude is determined. It is found that low-redshift compact clusters form a very homogeneous group of objects with cores essentially devoid of blue galaxies. At redshifts greater than 0.1, compact clusters have significant numbers of blue galaxies, the fraction increasing with redshift. The colors of spiral galaxies in the cores of nearby clusters tend to be redder than those of spirals in the field.},

	Abstract = {We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos and their mass assembly histories using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the LambdaCDM cosmology. For each halo at z=0, we identify its merger history tree and determine concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late-forming galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that cvir ``observed'' at any epoch ao is strongly correlated with ac via cvir=c1ao/ac. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and ac, implying that the actual spread in cvir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in ac. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir and the scatter about the median cvir(M,z) using accretion histories derived from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations; this new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates, the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant, and the halo concentration just grows as Rvir. Because of the direct connection between halo concentration and velocity rotation curves and because of probable connections between halo mass assembly history and star formation history, the tight correlation between these properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of local post-starburst galaxies (PSGs) using the photometric and spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the results from the Galaxy Zoo project. We find that the majority of our local PSG population have neither early- nor late-type morphologies but occupy a well-defined space within the colour-stellar mass diagram, most notably, the low-mass end of the 'green valley' below the transition mass thought to be the mass division between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass passively evolving bulge-dominated galaxies. Our analysis suggests that it is likely that local PSGs will quickly transform into 'red', low-mass early-type galaxies as the stellar morphologies of the 'green' PSGs largely resemble that of the early-type galaxies within the same mass range. We propose that the current population of PSGs represents a population of galaxies which is rapidly transitioning between the star-forming and the passively evolving phases. Subsequently, these PSGs will contribute towards the build-up of the low-mass end of the 'red sequence' once the current population of young stars fade and stars are no longer being formed. These results are consistent with the idea of 'downsizing' where the build-up of smaller galaxies occurs at later epochs. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 250 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at .},

	Abstract = {There are good observational reasons to believe that the progenitors of these red galaxies have undergone starbursts, followed by a poststarburst phase. Poststarburst (``K+A'' or ``E+A'') galaxies appear in the SDSS visible spectroscopic data by showing an excess of A-star light but relatively little Halpha emission. We investigate the environments of these galaxies by measuring (1) number densities in 8 h-1 Mpc radius comoving spheres, (2) transverse distances to nearest Virgo-like galaxy clusters, and (3) transverse distances to nearest luminous-galaxy neighbors. We compare the poststarburst galaxies to currently star-forming galaxies identified solely by A-star excess or Halpha emission. We find that poststarburst galaxies are in the same kinds of environments as star-forming galaxies; this is our ``null hypothesis.'' More importantly, we find that at each value of the A-star excess, the star-forming and poststarburst galaxies lie in very similar distributions of environment. Other studies finding similar results have argued that galaxy transformations occur slowly (timescales >1 Gyr), but this is at odds with the evidence that red galaxies are formed via starbursts. The only deviations from our null hypothesis are barely significant: a slight deficit of poststarburst galaxies (relative to the star-forming population) in very low-density regions, a small excess inside the virial radii of clusters, and a slight excess with nearby neighbors. None of these effects is strong enough to make the poststarburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon, or to argue that the starburst events are primarily triggered by external tidal impulses from close passages. The small excess inside cluster virial radii suggests that some poststarbursts are triggered by interactions with the intracluster medium, but this represents a very small fraction of all poststarburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of an extended narrow-band Halpha study of the massive galaxy cluster XMMU J2235.3-2557 at z= 1.39. This paper represents a follow-up study to our previous investigation of star formation in the cluster centre, extending our analysis out to a projected cluster radius of 1.5 Mpc. Using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrograph on Gemini North Telescope we obtained deep H narrow-band imaging corresponding to the rest-frame wavelength of Halpha at the cluster's redshift. We identify a total of 163 potential cluster members in both pointings, excluding stars based on their near-infrared colours derived from VLT/HAWK-I imaging. Of these 163 objects 14 are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, and 20 per cent are excess line emitters. We find no evidence of star formation activity within a radius of 200 kpc of the brightest cluster galaxy in the cluster core. Dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) of excess emitters outside this cluster quenching radius, ? kpc, are on average <SFR>= 2.7 $\pm$ 1.0 M&sun; yr-1, but do not show evidence of increasing SFRs towards the extreme 1.5 Mpc radius of the cluster. No individual cluster galaxy exceeds an SFR of 6 M&sun; yr-1. Massive galaxies (log M*/M&sun; > 10.75) all have low specific SFRs (SSFRs, i.e. SFR per unit stellar mass). At fixed stellar mass, galaxies in the cluster centre have lower SSFRs than the rest of the cluster galaxies, which in turn have lower SSFRs than field galaxies at the same redshift by a factor of a few to 10. For the first time we can demonstrate through measurements of individual SFRs that already at very early epochs (at an age of the Universe of ˜4.5 Gyr) the suppression of star formation is an effect of the cluster environment which persists at fixed galaxy stellar mass.},

@article{tyler11,
	Abstract = {Galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) are sensitive to the local environment; for example, the high-density regions at the cores of dense clusters are known to suppress star formation. It has been suggested that galaxy transformation occurs largely in groups, which are the intermediate step in density between field and cluster environments. In this paper, we use deep MIPS 24 mum observations of intermediate-redshift (0.3 <~ z <~ 0.55) group and field galaxies from the Group Environment and Evolution Collaboration (GEEC) subset of the Second Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC2) survey to probe the moderate-density environment of groups, wherein the majority of galaxies are found. The completeness limit of our study is log (L TIR(L sun)) >~ 10.5, corresponding to SFR gsim2.7 M sun yr-1. We find that the group and field galaxies have different distributions of morphologies and mass. However, individual group galaxies have star-forming properties comparable to those of field galaxies of similar mass and morphology; that is, the group environment does not appear to modify the properties of these galaxies directly. There is a relatively large number of massive early-type group spirals, along with E/S0 galaxies, that are forming stars above our detection limit. These galaxies account for the nearly comparable level of star-forming activity in groups as compared with the field, despite the differences in mass and morphology distributions between the two environments. The distribution of specific SFRs (SFR/M *) is shifted to lower values in the groups, reflecting the fact that groups contain a higher proportion of massive and less active galaxies. Considering the distributions of morphology, mass, and SFR, the group members appear to lie between field and cluster galaxies in overall properties.},

We used a low-dispersion prism in IMACS on the 6.5 m Baade (Magellan I) telescope to obtain spectra and measured redshifts to a precision of sigma z /(1 + z) ~ 1% for galaxies with z AB < 23.3 mag. We utilized a stellar mass-limited sample of 977 galaxies above M > 1.8 × 1010 M sun (log M/M sun >10.25) to conduct our main analysis. With three different SFR indicators, (1) Spitzer MIPS 24 mum imaging, (2) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and (3) [O II]lambda3727 emission, we find the median specific SFR (SSFR) and SFR to decline from the low-density field to the cores of groups and a rich cluster. For the SED- and [O II]-based SFRs, the decline in SSFR is roughly an order of magnitude while for the MIPS-based SFRs, the decline is a factor of ~4. We find approximately the same magnitude of decline in SSFR even after removing the sample of galaxies near the cluster. Galaxies in groups and a cluster at these redshifts therefore have lower star formation (SF) activity than galaxies in the field, as is the case at z ~ 0. We investigated whether the decline in SFR with increasing density is caused by a change in the proportion of quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) or by a decline in the SFRs of SFGs. Using the rest-frame U - V and V - J colors to distinguish quiescent galaxies from SFGs (including both unattenuated blue galaxies and reddened ones), we find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases from ~32% to 79% from low to high density. In addition, we find the SSFRs of SFGs, selected based on U - V and V - J colors, to decline with increasing density by factors of ~5-6 for the SED- and [O II]-based SFRs. The MIPS-based SSFRs for SFGs decline with a shallower slope. The declining SFRs of SFGs with density are paralleled by a decline in the median AV , providing indirect evidence that the cold gas content that fuels future SF is diminished in higher density environments. The order of magnitude decline in the SSFR-density relation at 0.6 < z < 0.9 is therefore driven by both a combination of declining SFRs of SFGs as well as a changing mix of SFGs and quiescent galaxies.

The 69 systems in our sample are drawn from the Cluster Infall Regions Survey, and all have robust mass determinations. The all-sky WISE data enable us to quantify the amount of star formation, as traced by 22 mum, as a function of radius well beyond R 200, and investigate the dependence of total star formation rate upon cluster mass. We find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies increases with cluster radius but remains below the field value even at 3R 200. We also find that there is no strong correlation between the mass-normalized total specific star formation rate and cluster mass, indicating that the mass of the host cluster does not strongly influence the total star formation rate of cluster members.},

	Abstract = {We present the first wide-field Halpha imaging survey around the distant cluster RXJ1716.4+6708 at z = 0.81 with a narrow-band filter on MOIRCS/Subaru, which reveals the star formation activities down to a star formation rate (SFR) of ~1Msolaryr-1 without extinction correction. Combining with a wide-field mid-infrared (MIR) imaging survey with the AKARI satellite, we compare in detail the unobscured and obscured star formation activities in the cluster. We find that both Halpha emitters and MIR galaxies avoid the cluster central region and their spatial distribution is quite similar. Most of the Halpha emitters show blue colours, but we find some Halpha emitters on the red sequence. The MIR galaxies tend to be systematically redder than the Halpha emitters probably due to heavy dust extinction. Interestingly, the red Halpha emitters and the red MIR galaxies (i.e. dusty red galaxies) are most commonly seen in the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments, where optical colours of galaxies change. We investigate the amount of hidden star formation by calculating a ratio, SFR(IR)/SFR(Halpha), and find that AHalpha exceeds ~3 in extreme cases for actively star-forming galaxies with SFR(IR) >~20Msolaryr-1. It is notable that most of such very dusty galaxies with AHalpha >~ 3 are also located in the medium-density environment. These findings suggest that dusty star formation is triggered in the infall region of the cluster, implying a probable link between galaxy transition and dusty star formation. We finally calculate the cluster total SFR and find that the cluster total SFR based on Halpha alone can be underestimated more than a factor of ~2 even after 1-mag extinction correction. We suggest that the mass-normalized cluster SFR rapidly declines since z ~ 1 following ~ (1 + z)6, although the uncertainty is still large.},

	Abstract = {We present environmental dependence of dusty star-forming activity in and around the cluster RXJ1716.4+6708 at z = 0.81 based on wide-field and multiwavelength observations with the Prime Focus Camera on the Subaru Telescope (Suprime-Cam) and the Infrared Camera onboard the AKARI satellite. Our optical data show that the optical colour distribution of galaxies starts to dramatically change from blue to red at the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments. By combining with the AKARI infrared data, we find that 15-mum-detected galaxies tend to have optical colours between the red sequence and the blue cloud with a tail into the red sequence, consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies.  The spatial distribution of the 15-mum-detected galaxies over ~200 arcmin2 around the cluster reveals that few 15-mum galaxies are detected in the cluster central region. This is probably due to the low star-forming activity in the cluster core. However, interestingly, the fraction of 15-mum-detected galaxies in the medium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, despite the fact that the optical colours start to change in the medium-density environments. Furthermore, we find that 15-mum-detected galaxies which have optically red colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specific star formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment. These results imply that the star-forming activity in galaxies in groups and filaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to the medium-density environment (e.g. galaxy-galaxy interaction), and such a phenomenon is probably directly connected to the truncation of star-forming activity in galaxies seen as the dramatic change in optical colours in such environment.},

	Abstract = {We present first results from a narrowband imaging program for intermediate-redshift emission-line galaxies using the newly commissioned FourStar infrared camera at the 6.5 m Magellan telescope. To enable prompt identification of Halpha emitters, a pair of custom 1% filters, which sample low-airglow atmospheric windows at 1.19 mum and 2.10 mum, is used to detect both Halpha and [O II] lambda3727 emission from the same redshift volume at z = 2.2. Initial observations are taken over a 130 arcmin2 area in the CANDELS-COSMOS field. The exquisite image quality resulting from the combination of the instrument, telescope, and standard site conditions (˜0.55" FWHM) allows the 1.19 mum and 2.10 mum data to probe 3sigma emission-line depths down to 1.0×10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 and 1.2×10-17 erg s-1 cm-2, respectively, in less than 10 hr of integration time in each narrow band. For Halpha at z=0.8 and z = 2.2, these fluxes correspond to observed star formation rates of ˜0.3 and ˜4 M&sun; yr-1, respectively. We find 122 sources with a 1.19 mum excess and 136 with a 2.10 mum excess, 41 of which show an excess in both bands. The dual-narrowband technique, as implemented here, is estimated to identify ≳80% of z = 2.2 Halpha emitters in the narrowband excess population. With the most secure such sample obtained to date, we compute constraints on the faint-end slope of the z = 2.2 Halpha luminosity function. Fitting of a pure power law gives alpha = -1.85 $\pm$ 0.31, which is steeper than other recent estimates based on coarser selection techniques, but consistent within the typically large uncertainties that currently characterize such measurements. Combining our LF points with those at higher luminosities from other work, the slope decreases to alpha = -1.58 $\pm$ 0.40. These ""narrow-deep"" FourStar observations have been obtained as part of the larger New Halpha Survey, which will combine the data with ""wide-shallow"" imaging through a similar narrowband filter pair with NEWFIRM at the KPNO/CTIO 4 m telescopes, to enable study of both luminous (but rare) and faint emission-line galaxies in the intermediate-redshift universe.},

	Abstract = {We present new measurements of the Halpha luminosity function (LF) and star formation rate (SFR) volume density for galaxies at z ~ 0.8. Our analysis is based on 1.18 mum narrowband data from the NEWFIRM Halpha (NewHalpha) Survey, a comprehensive program designed to capture deep samples of intermediate redshift emission-line galaxies using narrowband imaging in the near-infrared. The combination of depth (≈1.9 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 in Halpha at 3sigma) and areal coverage (0.82 deg2) of the 1.18 mum observations complements other recent Halpha studies at similar redshifts, and enables us to minimize the impact of cosmic variance and place robust constraints on the shape of the LF. The present sample contains 818 NB118 excess objects, 394 of which are selected as Halpha emitters. Optical spectroscopy has been obtained for 62% of the NB118 excess objects. Empirical optical broadband color classification is used to sort the remainder of the sample. A comparison of the LFs constructed for the four individual fields covered by the observations reveals significant cosmic variance, emphasizing that multiple, widely separated observations are required for such analyses. The dust-corrected LF is well described by a Schechter function with L sstarf = 1043.00$\pm$0.52 erg s-1, Phisstarf = 10-3.20$\pm$0.54 Mpc-3, and alpha = -1.6 $\pm$ 0.19. We compare our Halpha LF and SFR density to those at z <~ 1, and find a rise in the SFR density vprop(1 + z)3.4, which we attribute to significant L sstarf evolution. Our Halpha SFR density of 10-1.00$\pm$0.18 M sun yr-1 Mpc-3 is consistent with UV and [O II] measurements at z ~ 1. We discuss how these results compare to other Halpha surveys at z ~ 0.8, and find that the different methods used to determine survey completeness can lead to inconsistent results. This suggests that future surveys probing fainter luminosities are needed, and more rigorous methods of estimating the completeness should be adopted as standard procedure (for example, with simulations which try to simultaneously reproduce the observed Halpha LF and equivalent width distributions).},

	Abstract = {We present a public catalog of galaxy groups constructed from the spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the fourth data release from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) Galaxy Redshift Survey, including the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). The catalog contains 1165 groups with two or more members in the EGS over the redshift range 0 < z < 1.5 and 1295 groups at z > 0.6 in the rest of DEEP2. Twenty-five percent of EGS galaxies and fourteen percent of high-z DEEP2 galaxies are assigned to galaxy groups. The groups were detected using the Voronoi-Delaunay method (VDM) after it has been optimized on mock DEEP2 catalogs following similar methods to those employed in Gerke et al. In the optimization effort, we have taken particular care to ensure that the mock catalogs resemble the data as closely as possible, and we have fine-tuned our methods separately on mocks constructed for the EGS and the rest of DEEP2. We have also probed the effect of the assumed cosmology on our inferred group-finding efficiency by performing our optimization on three different mock catalogs with different background cosmologies, finding large differences in the group-finding success we can achieve for these different mocks. Using the mock catalog whose background cosmology is most consistent with current data, we estimate that the DEEP2 group catalog is 72% complete and 61% pure (74% and 67% for the EGS) and that the group finder correctly classifies 70% of galaxies that truly belong to groups, with an additional 46% of interloper galaxies contaminating the catalog (66% and 43% for the EGS). We also confirm that the VDM catalog reconstructs the abundance of galaxy groups with velocity dispersions above ~300 km s-1 to an accuracy better than the sample variance, and this successful reconstruction is not strongly dependent on cosmology. This makes the DEEP2 group catalog a promising probe of the growth of cosmic structure that can potentially be used for cosmological tests.},

	Abstract = {We present single-S{\'e}rsic two-dimensional (2D) model fits to 167 600 galaxies modelled independently in the ugrizYJHK bandpasses using reprocessed Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven (SDSS DR7) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey Large Area Survey imaging data available from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) data base. In order to facilitate this study we developed Structural Investigation of Galaxies via Model Analysis (SIGMA), an R wrapper around several contemporary astronomy software packages including SOURCE EXTRACTOR, PSF EXTRACTOR and GALFIT 3. SIGMA produces realistic 2D model fits to galaxies, employing automatic adaptive background subtraction and empirical point spread function measurements on the fly for each galaxy in GAMA. Using these results, we define a common coverage area across the three GAMA regions containing 138 269 galaxies. We provide S{\'e}rsic magnitudes truncated at 10re which show good agreement with SDSS Petrosian and GAMA photometry for low S{\'e}rsic index systems (n < 4), and much improved photometry for high S{\'e}rsic index systems (n > 4), recovering as much as Deltam= 0.5 mag in the r band. We employ a K-band S{\'e}rsic index/u-r colour relation to delineate the massive (n > ˜2) early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the late-type galaxies (LTGs). The mean S{\'e}rsic index of these ETGs shows a smooth variation with wavelength, increasing by 30 per cent from g through K. LTGs exhibit a more extreme change in S{\'e}rsic index, increasing by 52 per cent across the same range. In addition, ETGs and LTGs exhibit a 38 and 25 per cent decrease, respectively, in half-light radius from g through K. These trends are shown to arise due to the effects of dust attenuation and stellar population/metallicity gradients within galaxy populations.},

@article{guo09,
	Abstract = {Using a statistically representative sample of 911 central galaxies (CENs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 group catalogue, we study how the structure (shape and size) of the first rank (by stellar mass) group and cluster members depends on (1) galaxy stellar mass (Mstar), (2) the global environment defined by the dark matter halo mass (Mhalo) of the host group and (3) the local environment defined by their special halocentric position. We quantify the structure of SDSS galaxies with a GALFIT-based pipeline that fits two-dimensional S{\'e}rsic models to the r-band image data. Through tests with simulated and real galaxy images, we demonstrate that our pipeline can recover S{\'e}rsic parameters without significant bias. We find that the fitting results are most sensitive to the background sky level determination, and we strongly recommend using the SDSS global value. We also find that uncertainties in the background sky level translate into a strong covariance between the total magnitude, the half-light radius (r50) and the S{\'e}rsic index (n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. Applying our pipeline to the CEN sample, we find that n of CENs depends strongly on Mstar, but only weakly or not at all on Mhalo. The n-Mstar relation holds for CENs over the full range of halo masses that we consider. Less massive CENs tend to be disc like and high-mass systems are typically spheroids, with a considerable scatter in n at all galaxy masses. Similarly, CEN sizes depend on galaxy stellar mass and luminosity, with early- and late-type galaxies exhibiting different slopes for the size-luminosity (r50-L) and the size-stellar mass (r50-Mstar) scaling relations. Moreover, to test the impact of local environment on CENs, we compare the structure of CENs with that satellite galaxies (SATs) of comparable Mstar. We find that low-mass (<1010.75h-2Msolar) SATs have somewhat larger median S{\'e}rsic indices than CENs of a similar Mstar. Furthermore, low-mass, late-type SATs are moderately smaller in size than late-type CENs of the same stellar mass. However, we find no size differences between early-type CENs and SATs and no structural differences between CENs and SATs when they are matched in both optical colour and stellar mass. The similarity in the structure of massive SATs and CENs demonstrates that the halocentric distinction has no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. We conclude that Mstar is the most fundamental property determining the basic structural shape and size of a galaxy. In contrast, the lack of a significant n-Mhalo relation rules out a clear distinct group mass for producing spheroids. The existence of spheroid CENs in low- and high-mass groups suggests that the morphological transformation processes that produce spheroids must occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.},

	Abstract = {We present a new automatic method to identify galaxy mergers using the morphological information contained in the residual images of galaxies after the subtraction of a smooth S{\'e}rsic model. The removal of the bulk signal from the host galaxy light is done with the aim of detecting the much fainter and elusive minor mergers. The specific morphological parameters that are used in the merger diagnostic suggested here are the residual flux fraction (RFF) and the asymmetry of the residuals [A(Res)]. The new diagnostic has been calibrated and optimized so that the resulting merger sample is very complete. However, the contamination by non-mergers is also high. If the same optimization method is adopted for combinations of other structural parameters such as the Concentration, Asymmetry, clumpineSs (CAS) system, the merger indicator we introduce yields merger samples of equal or higher statistical quality than the samples obtained through the use of other structural parameters. We investigate the ability of the method presented here to select minor mergers by identifying a sample of visually classified mergers that would not have been picked up by the use of the CAS system, when using its usual limits. However, given the low prevalence of mergers among the general population of galaxies and the optimization used here, we find that the merger diagnostic introduced in this work is best used as a negative merger test, that is, it is very effective at selecting non-merging galaxies. In common with all the currently available automatic methods, the sample of merger candidates selected is heavily contaminated by non-mergers, and further steps are needed to produce a clean merger sample. This merger diagnostic has been developed using the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS F606W images of the A901/902 multiple cluster system (z= 0.165) obtained by the Space Telescope A901/902 Galaxy Evolution Survey team. In particular, we have focused on a mass- and magnitude-limited sample (log M/M&sun; > 9.0, RVega, Total<= 23.5 mag) which includes 905 cluster galaxies and 655 field galaxies of all morphological types. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programme GO10395.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the interaction between galaxies and their surroundings is central to building a coherent picture of galaxy evolution. Here we use GALEX imaging of a statistically representative sample of 23 galaxy groups at z=0.06 to explore how local and global group environment affect the UV properties and dust-corrected star formation rates of their member galaxies. The data provide star formation rates out to beyond 2R_200 in all groups, down to a completeness limit and limiting galaxy stellar mass of 0.06 M_sun/yr and 10^8 M_sun, respectively. At fixed galaxy stellar mass, we find that the fraction of star-forming group members is suppressed relative to the field out to an average radius of R ~ 1.5 Mpc ~ 2R_200, mirroring results for massive clusters. For the first time we also report a similar suppression of the specific star formation rate within such galaxies, on average by 40% relative to the field, thus directly revealing the impact of the group environment in quenching star formation within infalling galaxies. At fixed galaxy density and stellar mass, this suppression is stronger in more massive groups, implying that both local and global group environment play a role in quenching. The results favor an average quenching timescale of at least ~2 Gyr and strongly suggest that a combination of tidal interactions and starvation is responsible. Despite their past and ongoing quenching, galaxy groups with more than four members still account for at least ~25% of the total UV output in the nearby universe.},

	Abstract = {We use HST/WFC3 imaging from the CANDELS Multi-Cycle Treasury Survey, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to explore the evolution of galactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses >3 × 1010 M &sun; from z = 2.2 to the present epoch, a time span of 10 Gyr. We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z = 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3 × 1010 M &sun; reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the S{\'e}rsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, S{\'e}rsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z < 2.2. Quiescence correlates well with S{\'e}rsic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with "velocity dispersion" and stellar surface density at z > 1.3, and somewhat less well at lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10 Gyr, in qualitative agreement with the active galactic nucleus feedback paradigm.},

	Abstract = {We explore the amount of obscured star formation as a function of environment in the Abell 901/902 (A901/902) supercluster at z = 0.165 in conjunction with a field sample drawn from the A901 and CDFS fields, imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope as part of the Space Telescope A901/902 Galaxy Evolution Survey and Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) Survey. We combine the COMBO-17 near-UV/optical SED with Spitzer 24 mu photometry to estimate both the unobscured and obscured star formation in galaxies with M * > 1010 M sun. We find that the star formation activity in massive galaxies is suppressed in dense environments, in agreement with previous studies. Yet, nearly 40% of the star-forming (SF) galaxies have red optical colors at intermediate and high densities. These red systems are not starbursting; they have star formation rates (SFRs) per unit stellar mass similar to or lower than blue SF galaxies. More than half of the red SF galaxies have low infrared-to-ultraviolet (IR-to-UV) luminosity ratios, relatively high S{\'e}rsic indices, and they are equally abundant at all densities. They might be gradually quenching their star formation, possibly but not necessarily under the influence of gas-removing environmental processes. The other gsim40% of the red SF galaxies have high IR-to-UV luminosity ratios, indicative of high dust obscuration. They have relatively high specific SFRs and are more abundant at intermediate densities. Our results indicate that while there is an overall suppression in the SF galaxy fraction with density, the small amount of star formation surviving the cluster environment is to a large extent obscured, suggesting that environmental interactions trigger a phase of obscured star formation, before complete quenching.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'e}rsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the S{\'e}rsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {The KINGFISH project (Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 61 nearby (d<30 Mpc) galaxies, chosen to cover a wide range of galaxy properties and local interstellar medium (ISM) environments found in the nearby universe. Its broad goals are to characterize the ISM of present-day galaxies, the heating and cooling of their gaseous and dust components, and to better understand the physical processes linking star formation and the ISM. KINGFISH is a direct descendant of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), which produced complete Spitzer imaging and spectroscopic mapping and a comprehensive set of multiwavelength ancillary observations for the sample. The Herschel imaging consists of complete maps for the galaxies at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum. The spectral line imaging of the principal atomic ISM cooling lines ([O I] 63 mum, [O III] 88 mum, [N II] 122,205 mum, and [C II] 158 mum) covers the subregions in the centers and disks that already have been mapped in the mid-infrared with Spitzer. The KINGFISH and SINGS multiwavelength data sets combined provide panchromatic mapping of the galaxies sufficient to resolve individual star-forming regions, and tracing the important heating and cooling channels of the ISM, across a wide range of local extragalactic ISM environments. This article summarizes the scientific strategy for KINGFISH, the properties of the galaxy sample, the observing strategy, and data processing and products. It also presents a combined Spitzer and Herschel image atlas for the KINGFISH galaxies, covering the wavelength range 3.6--500 mum. All imaging and spectroscopy data products will be released to the Herschel user-generated product archives.},

	Abstract = {In preparation for the full Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) extragalactic H I survey, precursor observations were carried out in 2004 August-September with the seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver system and the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processor spectral processors. While these observations were geared mainly at testing and debugging survey strategy, hardware, and software, approximately 48 hr of telescope time yielded science-quality data. The efficiency of system usage (allowing for minor malfunctions and the impact of radio-frequency interference) during that time was 75%. From those observations, an initial list of 730 tentative detections of varying degrees of reliability was extracted. Ninety-eight high signal-to-noise ratio candidates were deemed to be bona fide H I line detections. To test our ability to discriminate cosmic signals from radio-frequency interference and noise, 165 candidates ranging in reliability likelihood were reobserved with the single-beam L-band wide system at Arecibo in 2005 January-February. Of those, 41% were confirmed as real. We present the results of both the ALFA and the single-beam observations for the sample of 166 confirmed H I sources, as well as our assessment of their optical counterparts. Of the 166 sources, 62 coincided with previously known H I sources, while optical redshifts were available for an additional 18 galaxies; thus, 52% of the redshifts reported here were previously unknown. Of the 166 H I detections, 115 are identified with previously cataloged galaxies of either known or unknown redshift, leaving 51 objects identified for the first time. Because of the higher sensitivity of the Arecibo system, fewer than 10% of the 166 H I sources would have been detected by a HIPASS-like survey of the same region. Three of the objects have H I masses less than 107 Msolar. The full ALFALFA survey, which commenced in 2005 February, should detect more than 100 times as many objects of similarly low H I mass over the next 5 years.},

	Abstract = {We present the first installment of H I sources extracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) extragalactic survey, initiated in 2005. Sources have been extracted from three-dimensional spectral data cubes exploiting a matched filtering technique and then examined interactively to yield global H I parameters. A total of 730 H I detections are cataloged within the solid angle 11h44m<R.A. (J2000.0)<14h00m and +12deg<decl. (J2000.0)<+16deg and redshift range -1600 km s-1<cz<18,000 km s-1. In comparison, the H I Parkes All-Sky Survey detected 40 H I signals in the same region. Optical counterparts are assigned via examination of digital optical imaging databases. ALFALFA H I detections are reported for three distinct classes of signals: (1) detections, typically with S/N >6.5, (2) high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way or its periphery, and (3) signals of lower S/N (to ~4.5) which coincide spatially with an optical object of known similar redshift. Although this region of the sky has been heavily surveyed by previous targeted observations based on optical flux- or size-limited samples, 69% of the extracted sources are newly reported H I detections. The resulting positional accuracy of H I sources is dependent on S/N: it averages 24" (20" median) for all sources with S/N>6.5 and is of order ~17" (14" median) for signals with S/N>12. The median redshift of the sample is ~7000 km s-1, and its distribution reflects the known local large-scale structure including the Virgo Cluster and the void behind it, the A1367-Coma supercluster at cz~7000 km s-1, and a third, more distant overdensity at cz~13,000 km s-1. Distance uncertainties in and around the Virgo Cluster perturb the derived H I mass distribution. Specifically, an apparent deficiency of the lowest H I mass objects can be attributed, at least in part, to the incorrect assignment of some foreground objects to the cluster distance. Several extended H I features are found in the vicinity of the Virgo Cluster. A small percentage (6%) of H I detections have no identifiable optical counterpart, more than half of which are high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way vicinity; the remaining 17 objects do not appear connected to or associated with any known galaxy. Based on these initial results, ALFALFA is expected to fulfill, and even exceed, its predicted performance objectives in terms of the number and quality of H I detections.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a ~500 kpc H I extension southwest of the Virgo Cluster H I-rich pair NGC 4532/DDO 137, detected as part of the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) Survey. The feature is the longest and most massive H I tail structure so far found in the Virgo Cluster and, at 1.8 Mpc from M87, the most distant from the main concentration of the intracluster medium. The structure is spatially and spectrally separated into two ridges and is defined by diffuse emission and discrete clumps of mass (2.5-6.8)×107 Msolar. All emission is blueshifted with respect to the NGC 4532/DDO 137 pair emission. Including diffuse emission, the structure has a total mass of up to 7×108 Msolar, equivalent to ~10% of the system's H I mass. Optical  R-band imaging finds no counterparts to a level of 26.5 mag arcsec-2. The characteristics of the structure appear most consistent with a tidal origin.},

	Abstract = {We describe the various Halpha morphologies of Virgo Cluster and isolated spiral galaxies and associate the Halpha morphologies with the types of environmental interactions that have altered the cluster galaxies. The spatial distributions of Halpha and R-band emission are used to divide the star formation morphologies of the 52 Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies into several categories: normal (37%), anemic (6%), enhanced (6%), and (spatially) truncated (52%). Truncated galaxies are further subdivided on the basis of their inner star formation rates into truncated/normal (37%), truncated/compact (6%), truncated/anemic (8%), and truncated/enhanced (2%). The fraction of anemic galaxies is relatively small (6%-13%) in both environments, suggesting that starvation is not a major factor in the reduced star formation rates of Virgo spiral galaxies. The majority of Virgo spiral galaxies have their Halpha disks truncated (52%), whereas truncated Halpha disks are rarer in isolated galaxies (12%). Most of the Halpha-truncated galaxies have relatively undisturbed stellar disks and normal to slightly enhanced inner disk star formation rates, suggesting that intracluster medium-interstellar medium (ICM-ISM) stripping is the main mechanism causing the reduced star formation rates of Virgo spiral galaxies. Several of the truncated galaxies are peculiar, with enhanced central star formation rates, disturbed stellar disks, and barlike distributions of luminous H II complexes inside the central 1 kpc but no star formation beyond, suggesting that recent tidal interactions or minor mergers have also influenced their morphology. Two highly inclined Halpha-truncated spiral galaxies have numerous extraplanar H II regions and are likely in an active phase of ICM-ISM stripping. Several spiral galaxies have one-sided Halpha enhancements at the outer edge of their truncated Halpha disks, suggesting modest local enhancements in their star formation rates due to ICM-ISM interactions. Low-velocity tidal interactions and perhaps outer cluster H I accretion seem to be the triggers for enhanced global star formation in four Virgo galaxies. These results indicate that most Virgo spiral galaxies experience ICM-ISM stripping, many experience significant tidal effects, and many experience both.},

	Abstract = {The scale lengths of the old stars and ionized gas distributions are compared for similar samples of Virgo Cluster members and field spiral galaxies via Halpha and broad R-band surface photometry. While the R-band and Halpha scale lengths are, on average, comparable for the combined sample, we find significant differences between the field and cluster samples. While the Halpha scale lengths of the field galaxies are a factor of 1.14+/-0.07 longer, on average, than their R-band scale lengths, the Halpha scale lengths of Virgo Cluster members are, on average, 20% smaller than their R-band scale lengths. Furthermore, in Virgo, the scale length ratios are correlated with the size of the star-forming disk: galaxies with smaller overall Halpha extents also show steeper radial falloff of star formation activity. At the same time, we find no strong trends in scale length ratio as a function of other galaxy properties, including galaxy luminosity, inclination, morphological type, central R-band light concentration, or bar type. Our results for Halpha emission are similar to other results for dust emission, suggesting that Halpha and dust have similar distributions. The environmental dependence of the Halpha scale length places additional constraints on the evolutionary process(es) that cause gas depletion and a suppression of the star formation rate in clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Low-dispersion optical spectra of SN 1993J taken at the MDM Observatory during the first 500 days are presented. These data include nightly spectra during the first week and individual spectra taken at 1,6,10, 11, 12, and 16 months after explosion. The spectra document the supernova's transformation from a SN II to SN Ib and the transition into the nebular phase. Spectra taken 1993 March 31-April 7 resolve some discrepancies in reported spectral features through a comparison of MDM data with other published datasets. Early-time expansion velocities for Halpha, Hbeta, and He I using absorption minima of P-Cygni features are reported along with photospheric temperatures determined through the fitting of reddened blackbody curves. Spectra covering the time period of 300 to 500 days after explosion show the reemergence of broad Halpha emission (FWZI = 2 x 10^4^ km s^-1^) with a peak flux level of 3.3 x 10^16^ erg s^-1^ cm^-2^ A^-1^ in 1994 June. Late-time spectra also reveal the reappearance of narrow Halpha emission after day 300. This emission is likely due to faint H II region emission near the SN 1993J site.},

@article{hall01,
	Abstract = {We have previously identified an excess population of predominantly red galaxies around a sample of 31 radio-loud quasars (RLQs) at 1<z<2. Here we show that these fields have a surface density of extremely red objects (EROs, with R-K>6) 2.7 times higher than the general field. Assuming these EROs are passively evolved galaxies at the quasar redshifts, they have characteristic luminosities of only ~L*. Only one of four RLQ fields has an excess of J-K-selected EROs with J-K>2.5 thus, those objects are mostly unrelated to the quasars. We also present new multiwavelength data and analyses on the fields of four of these quasars at zq~1.54, obtained to build more detailed pictures of the environments of these quasars and the galaxies within them. First, wide-field J and Ks data show that the galaxy excess around Q0835+580 is of Abell richness 2+/-1 and extends to 140" and that the galaxy excess around Q1126+101 extends to only 50", even though the overall counts in the field are higher than the literature average. Second, in three fields we present the deepest narrowband redshifted Halpha observations yet published. We detect five candidate galaxies at the quasar redshifts, a surface density 2.5 times higher than in the only existing random-field survey of similar depth. However, photometric spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of one candidate suggests that it is an [O III] detection background to the quasar. Third, SCUBA submillimeter observations of three fields detect two of the quasars and two galaxies with SEDs best fitted as highly reddened galaxies at the quasar redshifts. Fourth, H-band adaptive optics (AO) imaging is used to estimate redshifts for two moderately red bulge-dominated galaxies in the Q0835+580 field using the Kormendy relation between central surface brightness and half-light radius. Both have structural redshifts consistent with early-type galaxies foreground to the quasar at z<~0.2 or 1<~z<~1.35. Photometric redshifts do not confirm these structural redshifts, however, possibly because our optical photometry for these objects is corrupted by scattered light from the nearby bright AO guide star. Finally, quantitative SED fits are presented for numerous galaxies of interest in two fields and are used to constrain their photometric redshifts, zph. Most galaxies in the spatially compact group around Q0835+580 are consistent with being at the quasar redshift zq. One of these is a candidate very old galaxy without ongoing star formation, while the others appear to have ongoing or recent star formation. Many very and extremely red objects across both fields have zph~=zq, and significant dust is required to fit most of them, including about half of the objects whose fits also require relatively old stellar populations. Large reddenings of E(B-V)~=0.6+/-0.3 are also required to fit four J-K-selected EROs in the Q1126+101 field, though all but one of them have best-fit redshifts zph>zq. These objects may represent a population of dusty high-redshift galaxies underrepresented in optically selected samples. Taken together, these observations reinforce the claim that radio-loud quasars at zq>1 can be found in galaxy overdensities. Ongoing star formation with moderate amounts of dust seems to be common among all but the very reddest galaxies in these overdensities.},

With a 1024×1024 pixel, 1-2.5 mum detector, the PISCES camera provides 8.5' and 3.16' fields at the 2.3 m Bok telescope and 6.5 m Multiple Mirror Telescope, respectively. Its refractive optics utilize all spherical surfaces and standard glasses. A cold pupil stop suppresses the thermal background produced by the emissive surfaces normally present in Cassegrain optical configurations. The optical design is directly extendable to wider fields with larger detector formats. Future upgrades include low-resolution (R=200-500) multiobject spectroscopy.

	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) data on the large-scale environments of 16 0.39<z<0.51 quasars from the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS). The LBQS quasars are representative of the radio-quiet population, and this is one of the first looks at their large-scale environments. We compare the LBQS environments with the environments of 27 0.15<z<0.55 quasars selected from the HST archive. The majority of the Archive quasars are from the PG and PKS surveys, and these quasars are more luminous on average than the LBQS. By comparing the LBQS and Archive environments, we investigate whether previous quasar environment studies have been biased as a result of studying unusually radio or optically luminous quasars. We compare observed galaxy number counts with expected counts predicted from the CNOC2 field galaxy luminosity function in order to look for statistical excesses of galaxies around the quasars. We detect a significant excess around the Archive quasars but find no such excess around the LBQS quasars. We calculate the amplitude of the spatial correlation function and find that the LBQS environments are consistent with that of the typical galaxy while the Archive environments are slightly less rich than Abell 0 clusters. We find no difference between the environments of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars in either sample. However, comparison with previously published work shows that the LBQS radio-loud quasars are in sparse environments when compared with other radio-loud quasars, and the Archive radio-quiet quasars are in dense environments compared to other radio-quiet quasars. The richer environments of the Archive radio-quiet quasars cannot be explained by their higher optical luminosities. We find a positive correlation (95%) between radio luminosity and environment for the radio-loud quasars. This may explain why the LBQS radio-loud quasars, which are less radio luminous, are in sparser environments.

	Abstract = {We present Halpha-derived star formation rates (SFRs) for the galaxy cluster Cl J0023+0423B at z=0.845. Our 3 sigma flux limits correspond to an SFR of 0.24 h-2100 Msolar yr-1, and our minimum reliable Halpha+[NII] equivalent width is greater than 10 {\AA}, demonstrating that near-infrared narrowband imaging can sample the star-forming galaxy population in distant clusters. Comparison with spectroscopy shows that the number of false detections is low (9%+/-6%) and that our Halpha equivalent widths are correlated with spectroscopically determined [O II] equivalent widths. A magnitude-limited spectroscopic survey conducted over the same area missed 70% of the star-forming galaxies and 65% of the integrated star formation. Using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 Archive images, we fit Sersic profiles to all galaxies with significant narrowband equivalent widths and find that equivalent width decreases as the steepness of galaxy profile increases. We find no significant population of early-type galaxies with ongoing star formation. The integrated SFR per cluster mass of Cl J0023+0423B is a factor of 10 higher than that of the three z~0.2 clusters in the literature with available Halpha observations. A larger sample of z~0.8 clusters spanning a range of cluster masses is needed to determine whether this variation is due to a difference in cluster mass or redshift.

	Abstract = {We have identified perhaps the largest major galaxy merger ever seen. While analyzing Spitzer IRAC images of CL 0958+4702, an X-ray-selected cluster at z=0.39, we discovered an unusual plume of stars extending >~110 h-1 kpc outward from the bright central galaxy (BCG). Three galaxies 1-1.5 mag fainter than the BCG lie within 17 kpc (projected) of the BCG and are probably participating in the merger. The plume is detected in all four IRAC channels and at optical wavelengths in images from the WIYN telescope; the surface brightness is remarkably high (mur~24.8 mag arcsec-2 at 50 kpc). The optical and infrared colors are consistent with those of other BCGs, suggesting that the plume is composed of old stars and negligible recent star formation (hence a ``dry merger''). The luminosity in the plume is at least equivalent to a 4L* galaxy. A diffuse halo extending 110 h-1 kpc from the BCG in one IRAC image suggests the total amount of diffuse light is Lr~1.3×1011 h-2 Lsolar. A Chandra observation shows an X-ray image and spectrum typical of moderate-mass clusters. We use MMT/Hectospec to measure 905 redshifts in a 1 deg2 region around the cluster. The velocities of two of the BCG companions indicate a merger timescale for the companion galaxies of ~110 Myr and ~0.5-1 Gyr for the plume. We conclude that the BCG and intracluster light of CL 0958 is formed by major mergers at moderate redshifts. After the major merger is complete, CL 0958 will likely become a fossil cluster.},

	Abstract = {We present Halpha-derived SFRs for three z~=0.75 galaxy clusters. Our 1 sigma flux limit corresponds to a star formation rate (SFR) of 0.10-0.24 h-2100 Msolar yr-1, and our minimum reliable Halpha+[N II] rest-frame equivalent width is 10 {\AA}. We show that Halpha narrowband imaging is an efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. In two out of three clusters, we find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center. We also find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxy surface density in the same two clusters. We compare the median rate of star formation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-forming field galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster SFRs are ~50% less than the median field SFR. We characterize cluster evolution in terms of the mass-normalized integrated cluster SFR and find that the z~=0.75 clusters have more SFR per cluster mass on average than the z<=0.4 clusters from the literature. The interpretation of this result is complicated by the dependence of the mass-normalized SFR on cluster mass and the lack of sufficient overlap in the mass ranges covered by the low- and high-redshift samples. We find that the fraction and luminosities of the brightest starburst galaxies at z~=0.75 are consistent with their being progenitors of the poststarburst galaxies at z~=0.45 if the poststarburst phase lasts several (~5) times longer than the starburst phase.

	Abstract = {We investigate the star formation properties of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters as a function of cluster mass for 308 low-redshift clusters drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) C4 cluster catalog. It is important to establish if cluster star formation properties have a mass dependence before comparing clusters at different epochs, and here we use cluster velocity dispersion, sigma, as a measure of cluster mass. We select clusters with no significant substructure, a subset of the full C4 sample, so that velocity dispersion is an accurate tracer of cluster mass. We find that the total stellar mass, the number of star-forming galaxies, and total star formation rate scale linearly with the number of member galaxies, with no residual dependence on cluster velocity dispersion. With the mass-dependence of cluster star formation rates established, we compare the SDSS clusters with a sample of z~=0.75 clusters from the literature and find that on average (correcting for the mass growth of clusters between the two redshifts) the total Halpha luminosity of the high-redshift clusters is 10 times greater than that of the low-redshift clusters. This can be explained by a decline in the Halpha luminosities of individual cluster galaxies by a factor of up to ~10 since z~=0.75. The magnitude of this evolution is comparable to that of field galaxies over a similar redshift interval, and thus the effect of the cluster environment on the evolution of star-forming galaxies is at most modest. Our results suggest that the physical mechanism driving the evolution of cluster star formation rates is independent of cluster mass, at least for clusters with velocity dispersion greater than 450 km s-1, and operates over a fairly long timescale such that the star formation rates of individual galaxies decline by an order of magnitude over ~7 billion years.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how the [O II] properties and the morphologies of galaxies in clusters and groups at z=0.4-0.8 depend on projected local galaxy density, and compare with the field at similar redshifts and clusters at low z. In both nearby and distant clusters, higher density regions contain proportionally fewer star-forming galaxies, and the average [O II] equivalent width of star-forming galaxies is independent of local density. However, in distant clusters the average current star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming galaxies seems to peak at densities ~15-40 galaxies Mpc-2. At odds with low-z results, at high z the relation between star-forming fraction and local density varies from high- to low-mass clusters. Overall, our results suggest that at high z the current star formation (SF) activity in star-forming galaxies does not depend strongly on global or local environment, though the possible SFR peak seems at odds with this conclusion. We find that the cluster SFR normalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with the star-forming fraction. These trends can be understood given (1) that the average star-forming galaxy forms about 1 Msolar yr-1 (uncorrected for dust) in all clusters; (2) that the total number of galaxies scales with cluster mass; and (3) the dependence of star-forming fraction on cluster mass. We present the morphology-density (MD) relation for our z=0.4-0.8 clusters, and uncover that the decline of the spiral fraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of type Sc or later. For galaxies of a given Hubble type, we see no evidence that SF properties depend on local environment. In contrast with recent findings at low z, in our distant clusters the SF-density relation and the MD relation are equivalent, suggesting that neither of the two is more fundamental than the other.  Based on observations collected at the European Sputhern Observatory, Chile, as part of large program 166.A-0162 (the ESO Distant Cluster Survey) and with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope with proposal 9476.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing 24 mum MIPS/Spitzer data and the [O II]3727 line of a sample of galaxies at 0.4 <= z <= 0.8 from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey, we investigate the ongoing star formation rate (SFR) and the specific star formation rate (SSFR) as a function of stellar mass in galaxy clusters and groups, and compare these with results from field studies. As for the field, we find a decline in SFR with time, indicating that star formation (SF) was more active in the past, and a decline in SSFR as galaxy stellar mass increases, showing that the current SF contributes more to the fractional growth of low-mass galaxies than high-mass galaxies. However, we find a lower median SFR (by a factor of ~1.5) in cluster star-forming galaxies than in the field. The difference is highly significant when all Spitzer and emission-line galaxies are considered, regardless of color. It remains significant at z > 0.6 after removing red emission-line galaxies, to avoid possible active galactic nucleus contamination. While there is overlap between the cluster and field SFR-mass relations, we find a population of cluster galaxies (10%-25%) with reduced SFR for their mass. These are likely to be in transition from star forming to passive. Separately comparing clusters and groups at z > 0.6, only cluster trends are significantly different from the field, and the average cluster SFR at a given mass is ~two times lower than the field. We conclude that the average SFR in star-forming galaxies varies with galaxy environment at a fixed galaxy mass.},

	Abstract = {We show that, observationally, the projected local density distribution in high-z clusters is shifted towards higher values compared to clusters at lower redshift. To search for the origin of this evolution, we analyse a sample of haloes selected from the Millennium simulation and populated using semi-analytic models, investigating the relation between observed projected density and physical three-dimensional (3D) density, using densities computed from the 10 and three closest neighbours. Both observationally and in the simulations, we study the relation between number of cluster members and cluster mass, and the number of members per unit of cluster mass. We find that the observed evolution of projected densities reflects a shift to higher values of the physical 3D density distribution. In turn, this must be related with the globally higher number of galaxies per unit of cluster volume N/V in the past. We show that the evolution of N/V is due to a combination of two effects: (i) distant clusters were denser in dark matter (DM) simply because the DM density within R200 (~ the cluster virial radius) is defined to be a fixed multiple of the critical density of the Universe, and (ii) the number of galaxies per unit of cluster DM mass is remarkably constant both with redshift and cluster mass if counting galaxies brighter than a passively evolving magnitude limit. Our results highlight that distant clusters were much denser environments than today's clusters, both in galaxy number and mass, and that the density conditions felt by galaxies in virialized systems do not depend on the system mass.},

	Abstract = {We present the average metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) of Lyalpha emitters (LAEs) measured from our large-area survey with three narrowband (NB) filters covering the Lyalpha, [O II]lambda3727, and Halpha+[N II] lines of LAEs at z = 2.2. We select 919 z = 2.2 LAEs from Subaru/Suprime-Cam NB data in conjunction with Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy. Of these LAEs, 561 and 105 are observed with KPNO/NEWFIRM near-infrared NB filters whose central wavelengths are matched to redshifted [O II] and Halpha nebular lines, respectively. By stacking the near-infrared images of the LAEs, we successfully obtain average nebular-line fluxes of LAEs, the majority of which are too faint to be identified individually by NB imaging or deep spectroscopy. The stacked object has an Halpha luminosity of 1.7 × 1042 erg s-1 corresponding to an SFR of 14 M &sun; yr-1. We place, for the first time, a firm lower limit to the average metallicity of LAEs of Z >~ 0.09 Z &sun; (2sigma) based on the [O II]/(Halpha+[N II]) index together with photoionization models and empirical relations. This lower limit of metallicity rules out the hypothesis that LAEs, so far observed at z ~ 2, are extremely metal-poor (Z < 2 × 10-2 Z &sun;) galaxies at the 4sigma level. This limit is higher than a simple extrapolation of the observed mass-metallicity relation of z ~ 2 UV-selected galaxies toward lower masses (5 × 108 M &sun;), but roughly consistent with a recently proposed fundamental mass-metallicity relation when the LAEs' relatively low SFR is taken into account. The Halpha and Lyalpha luminosities of our NB-selected LAEs indicate that the escape fraction of Lyalpha photons is ~12%-30%, much higher than the values derived for other galaxy populations at z ~ 2.  Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

	Abstract = {We present Spitzer MIPS 24 mum observations of sixteen 0.4 < z < 0.8 galaxy clusters drawn from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey. This is the first large 24 mum survey of clusters at intermediate redshift. The depth of our imaging corresponds to a total IR luminosity of 8 × 1010 L sun, just below the luminosity of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), and 6+1 -1% of MV < -19 cluster members show 24 mum emission at or above this level. We compare with a large sample of coeval field galaxies and find that while the fraction of cluster LIRGs lies significantly below that of the field, the IR luminosities of the field and cluster galaxies are consistent. However, the stellar masses of the EDisCS LIRGs are systematically higher than those of the field LIRGs. A comparison with optical data reveals that ~80% of cluster LIRGs are blue and the remaining 20% lie on the red sequence. Of LIRGs with optical spectra, 88+4 -5% show [O II] emission with EW([O II]) > 5 {\AA}, and ~75% exhibit optical signatures of dusty starbursts. On average, the fraction of cluster LIRGs increases with projected clustercentric radius but remains systematically lower than the field fraction over the area probed (<1.5× R 200). The amount of obscured star formation declines significantly over the 2.4 Gyr interval spanned by the EDisCS sample, and the rate of decline is the same for the cluster and field populations. Our results are consistent with an exponentially declining LIRG fraction, with the decline in the field delayed by ~1 Gyr relative to the clusters.},
