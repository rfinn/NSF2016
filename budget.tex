{\bf \large A. Salaries and Wages}
\end{center}

The normal course load at Siena College is 4 classes per semester.  Siena
has agreed to a 25\% course reduction to increase the amount of time the 
I can allot to research.  I have requested additional funds to reduce
my teaching load by one course each Spring semester so that I can
focus half of my time on research and prepare the summer research
projects for participating undergraduates.

Summary salary for the first year will be covered 
by funding from the Spitzer Space Telescope Guest Observer Program.  
The PI requests 2 months summer salary each additional year, and 
salaries are assumed to increase by 3\% per year.

\begin{center}
{\bf \large B. Other Personnel}
\end{center}

The PI will employ 3 undergraduates during summer months
for the 5 years covered by this proposal.  The current rate is \$9.50
per hour, and the undergraduate salaries include 40 hours per week 
for 10 weeks during the summer.  I have also requested salary for 
two undergraduates during the academic year.

\begin{center}
{\bf \large C. Fringe Benefits}
\end{center}

The fringe rate for full-time faculty and staff (including the research associate) 
is 8.6\% for the academic and summer salary.

The fringe rate for undergraduate students is 
12.15\% for summer research and 4.5\% for work completed during the
academic year.

\begin{center}
{\bf \large D. Equipment}
\end{center}

I have requested funding \$5000 the first year to 
to purchase two computers, one for the PI and the second to be used by undergraduates.  
Other students
will use existing computers that were purchased
from NASA/JPL funds.

\begin{center}
{\bf \large E. Travel}
\end{center}

The PI and
one undergraduate student will attend 
one meeting of the American Astronomical
Society each year to present results from this survey.  
The allowance per participant 
includes: \$350 for airfare; registration fee (\$300 for PI, 
\$100 for undergraduates); \$150 for hotel times 5 nights
(undergraduates in one room); \$50 per day allowance for food.  

This proposal will fund travel for the PI and one undergraduate student 
to Arecibo Observatory for two observing trips a year, with an allowance 
per participant per trip of: \$350 for airfare;
\$40 for dorm room times 6 nights; and a \$50 per diem.
We include an additional \$200 for a rental car or 
alternate transporation to and from the airport.

This proposal will fund travel for the PI to an international 
meeting for 3 out of 5 years with an allowance of:
\$1100 for airfare; \$300 registration fee; \$150 for hotel times 7 nights;
\$60 per day allowance for food.

%Materials/Supplies

Funds for publication are requested at the ApJ rate of \$150 per page.
I expect publications during the third and fifth years, approximately 15 pages
each, for a total publication cost of \$2250 per paper.


Funds are requested for an educational consultant of  
\$5000 for the first year for the consultant to design
and implement as assessment plan and \$3000 each subsequent year to perform a 
year-end evaluation.

Darren Broder (CV attached as Supplemental 
Document) will organize and run the fall workshop for high school physics teachers
for a fixed fee of \$1000 per year, and I have requested funds to cover
this.

Finally, I have requested funds to hire a computer consultant during the 
final two years of this program, at a fixed rate of \$5000 per year.  
The consultant will design and implement
a web interface to disseminate the scientific and pedagogic results of this
project.
