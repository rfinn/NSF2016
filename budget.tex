{\bf \large A. Salaries and Wages}
\end{center}

The normal course load at Siena College is 4 classes per semester.  Siena
has agreed to a 25\% course reduction to increase the amount of time the 
I can allot to research.  I have requested additional funds to reduce
my teaching load by one course each Spring semester so that I can
focus half of my time on research.  The \ha \ imaging campaigns will
occur during the spring semester, and the course release valuable time for the PI observe, reduce and analyze
the \ha \ imaging data.  In addition, I will prepare the summer research
projects for participating undergraduates.  

I request 2 months summer salary each year of the grant, and 
salaries are assumed to increase by 3\% per year.

\begin{center}
{\bf \large B. Other Personnel}
\end{center}

The PI will employ 4 undergraduates during summer months
for the 3 years covered by this proposal.  The current rate is \$10.50
per hour, and the undergraduate salaries include 25 hours per week 
for 10 weeks during the summer.  
We have also included funds to cover the cost of housing for the
summer students (\$135/week).  This helps defray the expense of
participating in summer research.

We have included funds for 2 students to continue work during the
academic year (10 hrs per week).

\begin{center}
{\bf \large C. Fringe Benefits}
\end{center}

The fringe rate for full-time faculty 
is 42.2\% for the academic and and 8.6\% for summer salary.

The fringe rate for undergraduate students is 
5.1\% for summer research and for work completed during the
academic year.

\begin{center}
{\bf \large D. Equipment}
\end{center}

I have requested funding \$5000 the first year to 
to purchase two computers, one for the PI and the second to be used by undergraduates.  

\begin{center}
{\bf \large E. Travel}
\end{center}

The PI and
two undergraduate student will attend 
the winter meeting of the American Astronomical
Society during the second and third years to present results from this survey.  
The allowance per participant 
includes: \$500 for airfare; registration fee (\$500 for PI, 
\$200 for undergraduates); \$250 for hotel times 5 nights
(double occupancy for undergraduates); \$60 per day allowance for food.  

This proposal will fund travel for the PI, one co-I and two undergraduate students 
to Kitt Peak National Observatory for one observing trips a year, with an allowance 
per participant per trip of: \$500 for airfare;
\$125 per night for room and board at the observatory.
We include an additional \$200 for a rental car or 
alternate transporation to and from the airport.

This proposal will fund travel for the PI and co-I Desai to an international 
meeting during the third year with an allowance of:
\$1200 for airfare; \$300 registration fee; \$250 for hotel times 7 nights;
\$75 per day allowance for food.

%Materials/Supplies

Funds for publication are requested at the ApJ rate of approximately \$150 per page.
We expect publications during the first and third years, approximately 15 pages
each, for a total publication cost of \$2250 per paper.


%Funds are requested for an educational consultant of  
%\$5000 for the first year for the consultant to design
%and implement as assessment plan and \$3000 each 
%subsequent year to perform a 
%year-end evaluation.

Darren Broder (CV attached as Supplemental 
Document) will organize and run the fall workshop for high school physics teachers
for a fixed fee of \$1000 per year, and I have requested funds to cover
this.

{\bf \large G. Indirect Costs}
\end{center}

The indirect cost rate at Siena College is 21.3\%, excluding
equipment, Participant Support, and Subawards.
